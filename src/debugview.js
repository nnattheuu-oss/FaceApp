/*
 * Geometry debug view — pure HTML string generation.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS NOT IN ui.js ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `ui.js` wires the DOM at module scope, so it cannot be imported under
 * `node --test`. Keeping this rendering pure — report in, string out, no DOM —
 * means the view can be tested without a browser AND without a face photo.
 *
 * That matters because this view is the thing that satisfies "no black box":
 * every shape label must be traceable to the ratio that produced it. A view
 * that silently drops the trace would defeat the constraint while looking fine,
 * and the only way to catch that cheaply is to assert on the output string.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS VIEW MAY CONTAIN ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Measurements and the arithmetic behind them. No trait copy, no reading, no
 * rating, no health vocabulary. Interpretation is a separate layer.
