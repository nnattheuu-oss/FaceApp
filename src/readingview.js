/*
 * Renders Module A's reading, and Module B's output beneath its own disclaimer.
 *
 * Pure — report in, HTML string out, no DOM. Same reason as debugview.js: it
 * can then be tested with no browser and no face photo, and the structural
 * guarantees below are assertable on the output rather than trusted.
 *
 * ── THE TWO STRUCTURAL GUARANTEES THIS FILE OWES ───────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. A DISAGREEMENT NOTE RENDERS WHEREVER ONE EXISTS. The classical sources
 *    conflict — most sharply on Five Elements face-shape assignment — and a
 *    reading that quietly picks a side presents a contested mapping as settled.
 *    `sourcesNote()` is the one consistent pattern used for all of them.
 *
 * 2. MODULE B NEVER RENDERS INSIDE MODULE A. Advisories and referrals appear
 *    only under MODULE_B_DISCLAIMER, in their own block, visually separate. A
 *    reader must be able to tell which of two very different kinds of statement
 *    they are looking at without knowing this app's architecture.

/**
 * Summary card — the reading receipt, shown above the detailed sections.
 *
 * ── WHAT CHANGED AND WHY IT MATTERS ────────────────────────────────────────
 * The previous version built its subtitle by TRUNCATING a reading to 90
 * characters, or by taking `reading.split(".")[0]`. Every Module A reading
 * opens with its attribution — "In Mian Xiang…", "Classical Chinese face
 * reading…" — and cutting a sentence at a fixed offset can strand that
 * attribution, turning a statement about a tradition into a statement about
 * the reader. That is precisely the failure the copy guards exist to catch,
 * arriving through a code path they do not scan.
 *
 * So the summary no longer excerpts prose at all. It repeats measured VALUES,
 * and its one sentence is composed from the constructs that were read, with
 * the attribution built in. See reading/summary.js.
 *
 * @param {object} reading  `composeReading()` output
 * @param {object} [opts]
 * @param {string} [opts.caveatHtml]  the always-visible disclaimer, supplied by
 *        the DOM layer from index.html. It uses vocabulary the Module A copy
 *        blocklist forbids, so it cannot be a string literal in this file.
 * @param {string} [opts.actionsHtml] share/save controls, if the build has them
