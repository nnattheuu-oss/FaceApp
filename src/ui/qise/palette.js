/*
 * PHASE 9 — the palette.
 *
 * ── WHY THE SIMILES TRAVEL WITH THE HEX VALUES ─────────────────────────────
 * Every colour here is derived from Su Wen Ch. 17's own descriptions of what a
 * favourable showing looks like, and each simile is carried as data rather
 * than as a comment someone can delete. They are the reason the greens are
 * jade rather than indigo and the yellows are realgar rather than loess — and
 * without them the next person to touch this file has five arbitrary hex
 * values and every reason to "improve" them.
 *
 * Five accents, five colours, no sixth, no gradients. A sixth accent would
 * have nothing behind it: the classical scheme has five, and an accent with no
 * referent is decoration pretending to be meaning.
 */

/**
 * The five, plus the ground they sit on.
 *
 * `ground` is not a sixth accent. It is paper.

/**
 * The type stack.
 *
 * ── AN HONEST GAP, NOT A DESIGN CHOICE ─────────────────────────────────────
 * The brief names Bricolage Grotesque, EB Garamond, IBM Plex Mono and Noto
 * Serif SC, self-hosted as subset woff2 and preloaded. The families are
 * declared here so the intent is recorded and one edit switches them on, but
 * NO @font-face rule is emitted and no woff2 file is committed.
 *
 * Emitting @font-face for files that do not exist would be worse than the gap
 * it papers over: every load would fire four requests that 404, the service
 * worker would precache four missing entries, and `tests/source-integrity`
 * would be asserting against files nobody can produce from this repository.
 * The webfont import was removed from index.html for related reasons, and the
 * reasoning is recorded at the top of that file.
 *
 * What is outstanding is the font binaries and the subsetting, and that is
 * recorded in docs/QISE_NOTES.md rather than hidden behind a broken link.
