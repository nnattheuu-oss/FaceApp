/*
 * MODULE B — the safety referral path's interface to the colorimetry engine.
 *
 * ── THE BOUNDARY THIS FILE IS ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Takes the SAME `rawScalars()` input as `adapters/entertainment.js`, and is
 * the only place allowed to turn those neutral scalars into a referral
 * decision. Clinical vocabulary is permitted here and only here.
 *
 * Both adapters sit on one shared measurement layer that neither of them owns
 * (`engine.js`). That is deliberate: if Module B owned the measurement,
 * flag-disabling it would delete Module A's inputs too.
 *
 * ── POLICY THAT IS NOT NEGOTIABLE ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * Referrals are NEVER billed, NEVER paywalled, NEVER behind a subscription, in
 * either build flavour. The feature flag decides whether this module SHIPS, not
 * whether it is charged for. There is no price, tier or entitlement parameter
 * anywhere in this file and there must never be one.
 *
 * ── WORDING ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * No referral names a disease. Under TGA s41BD the general health/wellness
 * exclusion (14B) does not apply to software making claims about a serious
 * disease, and EVERY function must qualify or the exclusion is void for the
 * whole product. So a gate fires on the clinical criteria and says only that a
 * clinician should look, plus what to mention. Clinical function preserved, no
 * disease opinion rendered. Enforced by tests/copy-guard.test.js.
