/*
 * MODULE A — qi se (氣色), the complexion reading.
 *
 * Consumes `adapters/entertainment.js` output and NOTHING else. It never sees
 * the labelled observation path, so no condition name can reach it.
 *
 * Permitted vocabulary: glow, vitality, radiance, warmth, clarity, luminosity,
 * evenness. Forbidden: any condition name, any severity language, any clinical
 * term. Enforced by tests/copy-guard.test.js over this file's output.
 *
 * ── THE PARTIAL-BASIS RULE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The adapter drops a component it could not measure rather than scoring it
 * zero, and rescales. That is correct, but it means a reading built on two
 * colour signals is NOT the same object as one built on three, and presenting
 * them identically would be a quiet lie about how much was seen.
 *
 * So a reduced basis is always stated in the reading itself, in a sentence the
 * reader cannot miss — never a footnote, never omitted, and never smoothed
 * over by presenting the rescaled number as though it were complete.
