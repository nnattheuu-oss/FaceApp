/*
 * MODULE A — Twelve Palaces (十二宮).
 *
 * DR-2026-09-09-R8-TWELVE-PALACES-RESTORED supersedes this construct's
 * earlier universal WITHHELD_PENDING_SOURCE_REVIEW state and the R8
 * suppression mechanism that preceded it. Two separate product-owner
 * decisions govern what follows, and they are different in kind:
 *
 * 1. NAMING (settled, no ambiguity). 妻妾宮 and 奴僕宮 are rendered literally
 *    — "Wife/Concubine Palace" and "Servant Palace" — never suppressed, never
 *    modernised. The source is not softened because a name is uncomfortable.
 *    Romanised forms (e.g. "Qiqie Gong") appear in the strings below rather
 *    than the Han characters themselves: `tests/ui-language.test.js` pins a
 *    project-wide rule that reader-facing `src/` string literals stay
 *    English-only outside `heritage/` and `reading/provenance.js` — the same
 *    rule already governing every other Module A/Reflection Engine surface
 *    (see the fix to `src/qise/reflection-corpus.js` under this same DR). The
 *    literal Han characters are not hidden — they live uncensored in
 *    `src/heritage/evidence.js`'s twelvePalaces record — only kept out of
 *    files this specific guard scans.
 *
 * 2. STRUCTURE (a genuinely separate question). This project's own strongest
 *    evidence (`src/heritage/evidence.js`'s VERIFIED_PRIMARY Taiqing Shenjian
 *    citation, folio <pb:KR3g0045_WYG_001_17b>) does not agree with the
 *    received/widely-circulated palace layout on two slots: the Wealth
 *    Palace sits at the forehead/jaw in Taiqing Shenjian, not the nose; and
 *    Taiqing Shenjian's twelfth slot is a general "Appearance" category, not
 *    a dedicated Property Palace at all (`evidence.js`'s open
 *    `twelve-palaces-twelfth-slot` / `twelve-palaces-constituents`
 *    disagreements, on record before this session). This is not an offence
 *    question; it is the app's own primary sources disagreeing with each
 *    other about where two palaces physically are. The precedent for that
 *    already exists in this same module family — `three-courts.js` ships
 *    `heritageReading: null` and a `sourcesDiffer` note rather than silently
 *    picking a boundary when its own sources conflict. Wealth and Property
 *    follow the identical rule here: the region stays in the layout and is
 *    reported as measured, but no heritage interpretation is asserted for
 *    either, and the disagreement is disclosed rather than resolved by
 *    omission.
 *
 * The other ten palaces have no such conflict between this project's sources
 * and carry real, tradition-attributed reading content, cited to the same
 * Taiqing Shenjian folio for name and location.
