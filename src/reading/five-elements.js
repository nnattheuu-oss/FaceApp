/*
 * MODULE A — Five Elements typing (五行).
 *
 * Consumes the face shape from geometry.js. Emits attributed tradition and
 * nothing else: no trait is asserted of the reader, and every mapping names
 * the tradition it comes from.
 *
 * ── WHY EVERY SHAPE CARRIES A DISAGREEMENT NOTE ────────────────────────────
 * Because the sources genuinely disagree, and more here than anywhere else in
 * the system. The square face is read as Earth in many Mian Xiang texts and as
 * Metal in others; the diamond is not a classical category at all; "oval" is a
 * modern styling word that classical Chinese face reading does not use.
 *
 * Picking one silently would present a contested reading as settled, which is
 * the same failure as reporting an unmeasured value as zero. So `sourcesDiffer`
 * is REQUIRED on every mapping and the UI renders it beside the reading rather
 * than in a footnote.
