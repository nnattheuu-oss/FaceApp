 * Neutrally. This screen is information, not an apology and not a disclaimer.
 * It does not hedge the research to protect the product, and it does not
 * perform contrition about the product either — both would be a tone that
 * invites the reader to skip it.
 *
 * It is reachable in ONE TAP from the results screen. Not buried in an About
 * page, not behind a settings menu, and not dismissible by tapping past it
 * before it has been shown.
 *
 * This file is the single source for that content so the copy lint has one
 * surface to scan and the text cannot drift between screens.
