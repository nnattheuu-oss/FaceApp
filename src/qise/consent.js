/*
 * PHASE 0 — Consent, and the assertion that makes it load-bearing.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS THE FIRST FILE, NOT A LATE POLISH ──────────────────────────
 * Under the Australian Privacy Act, generating a 478-point facial mesh in RAM
 * and discarding it milliseconds later is still *collection* of sensitive
 * information. Transience is not a defence. The Administrative Review Tribunal
 * revisited exactly this in the Bunnings facial-recognition matter on
 * 4 February 2026: it set aside part of the 2024 OAIC determination, but it
 * AFFIRMED that information need not persist to count as collection, and
 * affirmed the APP 1 (transparency) and APP 5 (notification) breaches. The
 * APP 3.3 consent finding fell only because a "permitted general situation"
 * covered loss prevention in retail — a carve-out a consumer wellness app
 * cannot invoke.
 *
 * The net effect for us is the opposite of a relaxation: the two obligations
 * most clearly upheld on appeal are transparency and pre-collection notice,
 * which are precisely what this gate discharges. The same screen discharges
 * EU AI Act Art. 50(3) (biometric categorisation transparency), which requires
 * disclosure at or before first exposure — prominent, not buried in a policy.
 *
 * ── WHY WITHDRAWAL TAKES THE ERASER AS AN ARGUMENT ─────────────────────────
 * `withdraw()` REQUIRES a `deleteAll` function and throws without one. A
 * withdraw button that clears the consent flag and leaves the readings behind
 * is the failure this shape makes unrepresentable: the coupling is structural,
 * not a convention the next screen has to remember.
 *
 * Storage is injected for the same reason `createLandmarkerWithFallback()`
 * takes its factory (CLAUDE.md item 14) — a gate nothing can execute under
 * `node --test` is a gate nobody has run.
