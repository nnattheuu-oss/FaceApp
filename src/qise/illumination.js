 * face was lost, because the face-lost branch is the `else` of `if (mesh)` and
 * sits outside the block that owns the session. So a lost face left
 * `illuminationSession` non-null with the overlay still painted, and the
 * overlay can be mid-sequence: blue or green at 0.62 opacity over the preview.
 * The camera stayed open behind a preview that had gone dark, with the only
 * copy on screen reading "Bring your face into the frame."
 *
 * NO FACE IS CHECKED FIRST, and the order is load-bearing. `meanFaceRgb()`
 * reads the face regions, so without a mesh there is nothing to sample and the
 * remaining phases would record nothing whatever the gates said. Asking about
 * the gates first would answer a question that has already been settled.
