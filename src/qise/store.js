/*
 * PHASE 7 — persistence.
 *
 * ── WHAT MAY BE STORED, AND WHY THE LIST IS SHORT ──────────────────────────
 * Derived observation vectors, and nothing a face could be reconstructed or
 * recognised from. No image, no ROI pixels, no landmark coordinates, no
 * embeddings. A 478-point mesh IS a biometric template: in Australia that is
 * sensitive information under the Privacy Act, in Illinois it carries a
 * private right of action with per-violation statutory damages under BIPA, and
 * Washington's My Health My Data Act is broader still. The safest way to hold
 * biometric data is not to.
 *
 * Trends compute perfectly well from the derived vectors, which is the whole
 * reason this feature can exist at all.
 *
 * ── WHY THE RECORD SHAPE IS A PURE FUNCTION ────────────────────────────────
 * `toRecord()` is separated from the IndexedDB wrapper so the assertion that
 * matters — that no persisted key looks like an image, a pixel, a landmark or
 * an embedding — runs under `node --test` against the real shaping code,
 * rather than against a description of it. A privacy guarantee tested only
 * through a database mock is a guarantee about the mock.

 * numbers, booleans, strings and null, and drops objects and arrays. A nested
 * structure in one of these maps is not data this record is allowed to hold.
