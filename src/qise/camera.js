/*
 * PHASE 4 — camera capture, burst-based.
 *
 * ── WHY EVERY BROWSER OBJECT IS AN ARGUMENT ────────────────────────────────
 * `mediaDevices`, the landmarker and the clock are all injected, for the same
 * reason `createLandmarkerWithFallback()` takes its factory (CLAUDE.md item
 * 14): the paths that matter here are the FALLBACK paths — the browser that
 * strips the constraint, the browser that throws instead — and a fallback
 * nothing can execute is a fallback nobody has run. Injecting them is also the
 * only way any of this runs under `node --test`.
 *
 * ── WHY LOCKING IS AN IMPROVEMENT AND NEVER A PRECONDITION ─────────────────
 * `applyConstraints` does not reject an unsupported constraint. It silently
 * strips it and resolves successfully, so the only way to know what you got is
 * to read `getSettings()` back afterwards. Assume 'auto' is the common case:
 * Safari's ImageCapture support is partial and late, Firefox hides it behind
 * dom.imagecapture.enabled, and even where the constraint is accepted an
 * OS-level routine may override it. Every downstream metric must be valid
 * without locking, and `captureMode` is recorded on the reading so the
 * baseline can be reset when the class of capture changes.
