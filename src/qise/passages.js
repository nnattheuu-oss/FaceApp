/*
 * PHASE 8 — the passages.
 *
 * ── HOW THE CELLS ARE BUILT, AND WHERE THIS DEPARTS FROM THE BRIEF ─────────
 * The brief asks for templates keyed on (ascendant, magnitudeBand, ming/run
 * direction) with at least five variants per cell. Written flat that is
 * 6 x 3 x 5 = 90 cells and 450 passages of 40-70 words, and the honest
 * consequence of writing 450 of anything is that most of them are the same
 * paragraph with two adjectives moved.
 *
 * So a passage is COMPOSED from three keyed parts — the colour's reading, the
 * strength of its showing, and the course of lustre and moisture. Selection is
 * still keyed on the full triple, and every cell realises at least
 * 5 x 5 x 5 = 125 distinct passages rather than the five asked for. The
 * deviation is recorded in docs/QISE_NOTES.md.
 *
 * ── THE FOUR RULES EVERY STRING HERE OBEYS ─────────────────────────────────
 * 1. It opens with attribution. Never "This means".
 * 2. It describes what a tradition reads, never what is true of the reader.
 * 3. It carries no health vocabulary, and names no part of the body that a
 *    correspondence could be hung off. There is no organ mapping here and
 *    there is not going to be one: adding it is a request to become an
 *    ARTG-registered device, not a request for a feature.
 * 4. It makes no prediction. Nothing here says what tomorrow holds.
 *
 * The colour similes are Su Wen Ch. 17's own, and they are the reason the
 * palette looks the way it does. They are also the attribution: a passage that
 * cites the text it comes from is making a claim about the text.

    "the classical texts prize a red like vermilion wrapped in white silk, and warn against the flat red of ochre. What those readers looked for was warmth with light still behind it",

    "classical face reading places red at the south of its five-colour compass, the direction of summer. The texts describe it as vermilion under white rather than as a colour laid on plainly",
    "the tradition distinguishes two reds and cares only about the distinction: vermilion behind silk, which the texts call favourable, and the flat red of ochre, which they pointedly do not",
    "in Mian Xiang red is read as the colour of expansion and of the outward-moving season. The Su Wen describes the favourable form as vermilion covered with white, never as bare pigment",

    "the classical reading of yellow looks for realgar seen through gauze rather than the dry yellow of loess. The texts return to that image often and regard the veiled version as favourable",
    "in the Su Wen a favourable yellow is realgar covered with fine cloth, an unfavourable one the colour of dry earth. Classical readers held that the two look alike and are not alike",
    "Mian Xiang places yellow at the centre of its compass, the position without a season, associated with what holds steady while other things turn. The texts describe the shade as covered rather than bare",
    "the tradition reads yellow as the colour of the centre and of late summer, and describes the favourable form through a covering: realgar under gauze, never loess. The image does the work",
    "classical face reading gives yellow the middle place among the five colours. What the Su Wen praises is realgar behind thin cloth; what it does not praise is the flat yellow of dust",

  qing: [
    "the texts describe a favourable qing as moistened jade with grey in it, and an unfavourable one as flat indigo. Classical readers regarded the moisture as the observation, not the hue",
    "in the Su Wen qing is the colour of the east and of spring, of things beginning rather than arrived. The favourable form is jade that has been dampened, set against a dull blue-green",
    "Mian Xiang reads qing as the colour of the rising season, and the classical description is specific: greyish jade with moisture on it, not indigo. Those readers weighed the sheen above the shade",
    "the tradition places qing at the east of its compass. The Su Wen's image is moistened jade rather than a plain blue-green, and classical readers took that difference as the point of the observation",
    "classical texts describe qing through a stone rather than a pigment — jade, damp, with grey through it. The comparison with flat indigo is drawn deliberately by readers interested in the contrast",
  ],
  bai: [
    "the classical description of white is a goose feather, and the contrast drawn against it is salt. Readers of the Su Wen took the softness of the first as a different observation entirely",
    "in the tradition white belongs to the west and to autumn, the season of drawing in. The favourable form the texts name is goose down rather than the whiteness of salt",
    "Mian Xiang places white at the west of its five-colour compass. The Su Wen describes what it prizes as feather-white and what it does not as salt-white, not as degrees of one thing",
    "the texts give white the autumn position and describe it through a feather: soft, with depth behind it. The unfavourable comparison is salt, which is bright and has nothing behind it at all",
    "classical face reading reads white as the colour of the inward-turning season. The image the Su Wen uses is a goose feather; the image it warns about is salt",
  ],
  hei: [
    "the Su Wen describes a favourable dark as the lustre of black varnish and an unfavourable one as the grey of charcoal. The texts ask whether light returns, not how dark it is",
    "in the tradition black sits at the north of the compass, with winter and with what is held in reserve. The classical image is lacquer rather than ash",
    "Mian Xiang reads dark tones through the Su Wen's comparison: varnish, which has depth and returns light, against greyish charcoal, which does not. Both are dark and the texts keep them apart",
    "classical face reading gives black the winter position, the season of keeping rather than spending. The favourable form the texts name is the gloss of dark lacquer, never the flatness of charcoal",
    "the texts describe the favourable dark as varnish — deep, with light coming back off it. The comparison drawn against it is dry charcoal, and classical readers took that gloss as the observation",
  ],
  ping: [
    "the classical texts call a face with no colour rising level. It is not an absence of a reading. In Mian Xiang it is the reading, and the commonest one",
    "in the tradition level or even is what classical readers wrote down when nothing stood out. They regarded it as the ordinary state rather than a failure to observe",
    "Mian Xiang calls this level. Classical face reading regarded an unremarkable day as unremarkable, and the texts do not reach for a colour when none is showing",
    "the classical word here means level, and the texts use it without apology. Readers who worked this way expected most observations to be this one",
    "in the Su Wen's scheme nothing is ascendant today, which is a complete reading in the classical system rather than a gap in one",
