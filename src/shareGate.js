/*
 * Share-to-unlock gate.
 *
 * After a face reading, the detailed sections (Twelve Palaces, qi-se, the
 * remaining Module A cards) are gated until the user shares a plain text
 * link with two people. This is honour-system only — optimises for reach
 * rather than abuse prevention — and requires no backend.
 *
 * ── WHAT NEVER GOES IN THE SHARE TEXT ──────────────────────────────────────
 * No numeric scores, no beauty ratings, no health claims. The share message
 * names only that the user got a face reading and invites the recipient to
 * try it. Face shape is tradition-attributed per Module A rules and may be
 * included when a reading was successfully obtained, framed as "my reading
 * placed me in …" not "I am …".
 *
 * ── UNLOCK STATES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   "share"         — two successful Web Share calls, or two clipboard copies.
 *   "paid-lifetime" — one-time purchase. No expiry.
 *   "subscription"  — weekly access. Expires; see SUBSCRIPTION_DAYS.
 *   null            — locked.
 *
 * ── THIS IS A SOFT GATE. IT IS BYPASSABLE, BY DESIGN AND BY NECESSITY ──────
 * Read this before pricing anything against it.
 *
 * There is no backend. Every unlock state below lives in localStorage on the
 * device, which means anyone who opens devtools can grant themselves any of
 * them in one line, and anyone who reads the source can construct the redeem
 * URL by hand. Nothing here is an entitlement; it is a courtesy latch.
 *
 * That is not a defect to be fixed in this file — it is a direct consequence
 * of the no-account, no-server, nothing-leaves-the-device design, and the only
 * real fix is a server that verifies a receipt, which would mean an account,
 * which is the thing the privacy posture exists to avoid. The honest trade is
 * to accept the leak and keep the architecture.
 *
 * What follows from that, and must not be undone by a later "hardening" pass:
 *   - Do not put anything behind this gate that would be harmful to leak.
 *   - MODULE B IS NEVER BEHIND IT. Safety content is not paid content; see
 *     MODULE_B_IS_NEVER_MONETISED in flags.js. Only Module A reading material.
 *   - Do not add obfuscation that makes the code look authoritative. A latch
 *     that pretends to be a lock invites someone downstream to trust it.
 *
 * ── LOCALITY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * State lives in localStorage on this device. A user who clears storage, or
 * opens on a new device, starts from zero. That is consistent with the app's
 * no-account, no-server policy — and it means a paying user can lose access by
 * clearing their browser, which the purchase copy has to say plainly.

 * anything, because there is nothing to check it against. Someone who has
 * bought once can hand their redirect URL to anyone.
 *
 * Do not describe this as securing the gate, and do not build on it as though

 * is that payment is enforced by goodwill and the checkout being easier than
 * the workaround.
