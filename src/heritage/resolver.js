/*
 * Stage 2: the deterministic heritage connector resolver.
 *
 * This module answers one question: given an interpreted reading state, a
 * selected heritage construct/lineage, injected runtime evidence about which
 * participants/historical states currently hold, a presentation depth and a
 * deterministic occurrence, which registered connector-graph relationships
 * are eligible to be shown, in what structured form, and why?
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT a prose engine. It produces no sentences — only
 * structured, traceable selections over the Stage 1 registries. Prose
 * composition (src/qise/reflection.js) is Stage 3 and is not touched here.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS FILE HAS NO IMPORTS FROM src/qise/ ────────────────────────────
 * `resolveHeritageConnections` is a pure function of its arguments. Every
 * registry it needs is INJECTED, not imported at module scope, so a test can
 * swap in a synthetic registry without mutating runtime state (the same
 * reasoning `createHeritageRegistry(corpus)` in registry.js already uses).
 * The deterministic hashing below duplicates the ~8-line FNV-1a primitive
 * already in src/qise/passages.js (`seededIndex`) rather than importing it.
 *
 * ── THREE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS, NEVER COLLAPSED ─────────────────────────────
 * A first draft of this resolver conflated three genuinely separate
 * questions, and the correction below is organised around keeping them apart:
 *
 * 1. "Can this product's capture modality EVER support observing this?"
 *    A static registry fact — `measurementAvailability` on a connector, a
 *    construct's lineage, or a heritage concept. Answered by
 *    `classifyRelationshipAvailability`. NEVER used to decide whether a
 *    historical claim is TRUE.
 * 2. "Is this specific participant currently present, in THIS resolution?"
 *    A runtime fact, supplied by the caller via the injected
 *    `conditionContext.participants` map — never inferred from (1), from
 *    `readingState.availability`, or from anything else. Answered by
 *    `evaluateConditionExpression`'s PRESENT/ABSENT handling.
 * 3. "Has an explicitly authorised historical state been established?"
 *    Also a runtime fact, supplied via `conditionContext.states` — a
 *    `historicalState`'s declared `measurementAvailability` says what KIND of
 *    thing it is, not whether it currently holds. heritageQiSe and shen have
 *    no authorised binding from (1) or (2) into (3) — that binding does not
 *    exist in this codebase, so their STATE conditions can only ever resolve
 *    through an explicit, caller-supplied `conditionContext.states` entry.
 *
 * `readingState.availability` (read / abstained_*) answers a FOURTH question
 * — did today's qi-se compass measurement succeed — and is not consulted
 * anywhere in this file. Folding it into any of the three above is exactly
 * the "modern measured Qi Se proves the traditional appraisal" conflation
 * Stage 1 forbids.

 * `runtimeBindingContext`:
 *
 *   runtimeBindingContext: { attemptedBindings: [{ fromRef, toRef }, ...] }
