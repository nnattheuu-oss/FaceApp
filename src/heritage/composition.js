/*
 * Stage 3: the sole product-facing entry point into the heritage connector
 * graph. UI and Reflection Engine code must call `composeHeritageForReading`
 * — never `resolveHeritageConnections` directly, and never
 * `composeHeritageConnectionsWithRegistries` (the test/internal seam below)
 * — so gate precedence, canonical-registry ownership, and the
 * ACTIVE / SOURCE-PANEL / DISAGREEMENT / EDITORIAL / ABSTENTION split are
 * enforced in exactly one place.
 *
 * ── WHY GATES FAIL CLOSED ON "UNKNOWN", NOT JUST ON "FALSE" ─────────────────
 * A caller that has never been wired to real gate state and one that has
 * been wired and told "the gate failed" must not be treated the same as a
 * caller that has been wired and told "the gate passed". `captureQualityPassed`/
 * `safetyPassed` are read through `gateStatus()`, which recognises exactly the
 * boolean `true` as PASSED — `false` is FAILED, and anything else (`undefined`,
 * `null`, a string, an accidental `0`) is UNKNOWN. Both FAILED and UNKNOWN
 * suppress; only literal `true` proceeds. This is what stops the historically
 * easy mistake of a default parameter silently authorising output the moment
 * nobody has gotten around to wiring the real gate yet (see
 * docs/PRODUCT_DESIGN_V2.md's `captureQualityGate -> safetyGate ->
 * measurementLayer -> heritageLayer` precedence: "any gate firing suppresses
 * everything downstream" — an unwired gate has not been proven not to have
 * fired).
 *
 * ── WHY GATE SUPPRESSION IS NOT A STAGE 2 ABSTENTION ────────────────────────
 * `suppressed`/`suppressionReason` and `abstained`/`abstentionReasonCode` are
 * two different axes and must never be conflated. `suppressed` means this
 * module refused to call the resolver at all — an upstream fact, decided here,
 * before Stage 2 is ever reached. `abstained` is the resolver's OWN verdict
 * (e.g. `UNKNOWN_HERITAGE_CONSTRUCT`, `INVALID_RUNTIME_BINDING_CONTEXT`) and
 * is only ever `true` when the resolver actually ran and chose to abstain. A
 * suppressed result therefore always carries `abstained: false,
 * abstentionReasonCode: null` — there is no Stage 2 verdict to report, because
 * Stage 2 was never asked.
 *
 * ── WHY CANONICAL REGISTRIES ARE BOUND HERE, NOT INJECTED ───────────────────
 * `composeHeritageForReading` accepts only the finite runtime contract listed
 * in `RUNTIME_CONTRACT_KEYS` — no registry of any kind. `CANONICAL_REGISTRIES`
 * is a plain static import bound once, at module load, and is what every
 * production call resolves against; a caller cannot substitute a different
 * registry, accidentally or otherwise; passing anything outside the allowed
 * key set throws rather than being silently ignored. Registry injection
 * survives only as `composeHeritageConnectionsWithRegistries`, an explicit,
 * separately named seam for tests (and this module's own internals) that
 * need a synthetic universe — product code must not call it.
 *
 * ── WHY THE FINITE CONTRACT IS THIS NARROW ──────────────────────────────────
 * `heritageConstruct`/`sourceLineage` are the resolver's own declared
 * dependency surface (`RESOLVER_DEPENDS_ON` in resolver.js). This module
 * reconstructs a fresh `readingState` from exactly those two fields — it
 * never forwards a caller's full interpreted state, compass, history or
 * self-report, so modern Qi Se measurement cannot leak into the historical
 * graph as a generic predicate bag.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It produces no prose (Stage 2's constraint, inherited unchanged) and no
 * second selection/rotation mechanism — see src/qise/heritage-connections.js,
 * which is the ONLY caller of this module from product code, for how
 * `occurrence` is shared with reflection.js's own rotation rather than driven
 * independently. It does not persist anything; every field is recomputed on
 * every call.
 *
 * ── WHY `rotationState` IS NOT IN THE PRODUCT-FACING CONTRACT ───────────────
 * Stage 2's resolver accepts an optional `rotationState.recentConnectorIds`
 * to deprioritise recently-shown connectors ahead of its own deterministic
 * rotation. Exposing that on the product-facing contract would hand a caller
 * a SECOND, independently-suppliable selection input alongside `occurrence`
 * — exactly the "two independently driven rotation lifecycles" Stage 3 must
 * not create. There is also no canonical source for "recently shown
 * connector ids" today (Stage 3 deliberately persists nothing — see
 * docs/HERITAGE_CONNECTOR_STAGE_STATUS.md's "keep reading-state small"), so
 * there is nothing legitimate to derive it from yet. `occurrence` alone
 * already provides full, deterministic variation via
 * `rotateDeterministically`'s coprime-stride walk. `rotationState` remains
 * available ONLY on `composeHeritageConnectionsWithRegistries`, the
 * test/internal seam, for exercising the resolver's own already-tested
 * behaviour directly.
 *
 * ── THE LINEAGE ADAPTER ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `reading-state.js`'s `sourceLineage` is a two-value ABSTRACT rotation label
 * (`"primary"` / `"variant"`), general across all six constructs. The
 * canonical heritage registry's OWN lineages are construct-specific and
 * often richer (e.g. fiveMountains also has `"taiqing-siku"`, `"sxqb-chin"`,
 * `"shenyi-lower-face-zone"`). `resolveHeritageLineage()` is the explicit,
 * finite gate between the two: it accepts either the abstract label or an
 * explicit canonical lineage id, and returns that same string ONLY if it is
 * a lineage this SPECIFIC construct actually declares — never a different,
 * silently substituted witness, never a value borrowed from another
 * construct, and never Stage 2's own permissive "primary, else lexically
 * first" fallback (which never fails closed). An unresolvable pairing
 * abstains before the resolver is ever called.

 * always defaults to the string `"NOT_RECORDED"` in `registry.js`'s
