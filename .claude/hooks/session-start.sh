# dependencies installed, and dist/ built. The build is not optional here --
# `npm run lint:bundle` scans the ARTEFACT, not the tree (CLAUDE.md item 22), so
# without a build the compliance guards have nothing to read and report zero
# files scanned. A guard that passes by scanning nothing is the false-green this
# repo has shipped twice; the hook exists partly to stop it happening in a
# session too.

# No `|| true`, no swallowed errors: CLAUDE.md Verification Protocol item 6.
