/*
 * GPU→CPU fallback tests.
 *
 * The requirement is a CPU fallback that is ACTUALLY TESTED, not assumed. A
 * fallback path is the classic piece of code that is written once, never
 * executed, and quietly broken by a later refactor — so these tests drive the
 * GPU factory to throw and assert the CPU path is genuinely reached.
 *
 * The MediaPipe factory is injected rather than imported, which is why this is
 * testable at all: src/analysis.js imports the bundle from a CDN at module
 * scope and cannot be loaded under node --test.
