/*
 * Class-level guard on user-facing copy, now MODULE-AWARE.
 *
 * The two modules have different permissions, so one blocklist cannot serve
 * both:
 *
 *   Module A (rules-a.js) — entertainment. NO health vocabulary at all, and
 *     every trait mapping must name the tradition it comes from.
 *   Module B (rules-b.js) — health-adjacent. Clinical vocabulary is allowed.
 *     Naming a DISEASE is not, in either module: TGA exclusion 14B does not
 *     apply to software making claims about a serious disease, and every
 *     function must qualify or the exclusion is void for the whole product.
 *
 * This walks EVERY rule rather than whatever one scenario happens to fire,
 * because the defect that shipped was in an *advice* payload that no
 * referral-path test ever inspected — and ui.js renders `recommend[]`
 * verbatim into innerHTML, so advice is exactly as user-facing as a referral.
