/*
 * Stage 3 — the heritage connector composition boundary
 * (src/heritage/composition.js).
 *
 * This file does not re-prove Stage 2's own guarantees (condition AST
 * semantics, source-eligibility ladders, negative-rule matching — all
 * covered exhaustively by tests/heritage/resolver.test.js). It proves the
 * NEW thing Stage 3 adds at this boundary: gate precedence FAILS CLOSED on
 * missing/unknown evidence (not just on an explicit failure), gate
 * suppression is never reported as a Stage 2 resolver abstention, canonical
 * registries are bound internally and cannot be substituted by a caller, and
 * the typed A/B/C/D/E output split survives that rework unchanged.
 *
 * Tier 2/Tier 3 integration (src/qise/heritage-connections.js) has its own
 * suite: tests/qise/heritage-connections.test.js.

 * ── locator-status precedence: enrich, never overwrite (Copilot, suppressed

 * `withConnectorLocatorStatus()` reads the connector registry ONLY to fill
 * in `sectionLocatorStatus`/`folioLocatorStatus` when the resolved entry
 * doesn't already carry its own — never to overwrite a value the entry
 * already has. Today `resolver.js`'s frozen `toResolvedEntry()` never copies
 * either field onto a resolved entry (verified directly against its source,
 * lines 754-776), so `entry.sectionLocatorStatus`/`folioLocatorStatus` are
 * ALWAYS `undefined` on every real entry this function ever sees — meaning a
 * true runtime negative case ("an entry that already has its own status,
 * different from the registry's") cannot be constructed end to end without
 * reopening the frozen resolver boundary, which this pass must not do.
 *
 * So this is a source-text regression, not a behavioural one — the
 * "implementation-level regression test" the task explicitly sanctions as
 * the fallback here, rather than exporting `withConnectorLocatorStatus` as a
 * new product API solely to make it importable. `??` is safe specifically
 * because `registry.js`'s `connectorRecord()` factory (lines 219-234)
 * defaults these two STATUS fields to the string `"NOT_RECORDED"`, never
 * `null` — `null` is used in that same factory only for the locator VALUE
 * fields (`sectionLocator`/`folioLocator`), so nullish-coalescing on the
 * status fields specifically cannot confuse "not recorded" with "absent".
 * The existing end-to-end tests in tests/qise/heritage-view.test.js (item
 * 11, "four-rivers-flow-and-banks..."/"five-forms-generative-overcoming-
 * system...") continue to prove the fallback-FILL path still works with
 * real data — unaffected by this change, since `entry.*` is always
