/*
 * D-2 — WHY THE HERITAGE CONNECTOR CONTRIBUTED EXACTLY ONE STATE, AND WHAT
 * CHANGED UNDER DR-2026-08-31-D2-CONNECTOR-PREDICATE.
 *
 * ── THE ORIGINAL FINDING ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `connectorResidue()` returned 1 for every construct because
 * `composeLatent(...).active` was 0 or 1 everywhere. The cause was a
 * conjunction of two INDEPENDENT gates that turned out to be anti-correlated
 * across the corpus:
 *
 *   - `active` admission requires `runtimePolicy === HERITAGE_PRESENTATION_ALLOWED`
 *     (resolver.js:1050/1065/1084 divert everything else).
 *   - `classifyRelationshipAvailability()` grades a connector measurable only
 *     when the connector, every participant construct-lineage, and every
 *     historicalState all classify as `capturable`.
 *
 * Measured over the 15 connector records at the time, the cross-tabulation's
 * diagonal was EMPTY: no connector was both measurable and authorised.
 *
 * ── WHAT DR-2026-08-31-D2-CONNECTOR-PREDICATE CHANGED ──────────────────────
 * D2-1/D2-2 promoted `three-sections-facial-proportion-taiqing` to
 * `HERITAGE_PRESENTATION_ALLOWED`, and `ABSTRACT_LINEAGE_OVERRIDES` (added to
 * `composition.js` under the same decision) routes threeSections' abstract
 * "primary" request to the VERIFIED `taiqing-mianbu-facial` lineage instead
 * of the contested received-Ma-Yi lineage — see
 * docs/HERITAGE_CONNECTOR_RELATIONSHIP_CONTRACT.md §6 for the full trace.
 * This was ONE genuine cell on the diagonal, not zero.
 *
 * D2-3 added a SECOND: `three-sections-pingdeng-yuguan`, citing the
 * independently-evidenced, byte-pinned, VERIFIED_PRIMARY 玉管照神局 卷下 verse
 * (`heritage-three-sections-yuguan` — not a Ma Yi witness, not the same juan
 * as the Taiqing facial material). Both connectors share the threeSections
 * construct and the same routed lineage, so both receive the same
 * HERITAGE_ONLY ceiling and both reach ACTIVE — the diagonal now has TWO
 * genuine cells, not one. See contract §8.7 for the full trace. The tests
 * below are updated accordingly, together with that evidence and that
 * decision, as this file's own discipline requires.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS A TEST AND NOT ONLY A DOCUMENT ─────────────────────────────
 * CLAUDE.md's Verification Protocol §9: a constraint without a failing test to
 * protect it will be tidied away. The specific tidy-up this guards against is
 * someone raising Gate D by flipping a `runtimePolicy` or relaxing a
 * `measurementAvailability` — which would move the number without adding a
 * single genuine relationship, and would do it in a one-line diff that reads
 * as a configuration change.
 *
 * These tests are DESCRIPTIVE, not prescriptive. They record what the corpus
 * is today. Legitimately adding a source-attested relationship, or a
 * product-owner promotion decision (see docs/HERITAGE_CONNECTOR_RELATIONSHIP_
 * CONTRACT.md sections 3 and 5), SHOULD fail them — at which point the right
 * response is to update the recorded counts together with the evidence and the
 * decision that authorised it, never to loosen the assertion on its own. This
 * file's own history is now the proof: exactly that happened once already.
