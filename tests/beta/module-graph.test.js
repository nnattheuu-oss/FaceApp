/* The guard the beta did not have.
 *
 * beta/beta.js shipped importing "../engine.js" — a path that resolves to a
 * repo-root file which does not exist — so the beta page could not load in any
 * browser. Every test in this directory passed anyway, because they all read
 * the file as TEXT and scanned it with regexes. A module nothing imports is a
 * module nothing tests (CLAUDE.md item 18a).
 *
 * This test imports it for real. It fails on a broken import path, on a
 * top-level DOM access, and on a syntax error, none of which a text scan sees.
