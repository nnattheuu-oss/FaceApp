/*
 * PHASE 10, gate 1 — no network in the analysis path.
 *
 * Not telemetry, not runtime fonts, not anything. The whole claim of the
 * product is that the photograph never leaves the device, and the only way
 * that claim survives contact with a future contributor is if breaking it
 * turns CI red.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS SCANS src/ui/qise TOO, WHICH THE BRIEF DID NOT ASK FOR ────────
 * The brief scopes this rule to src/qise/**. But the view layer is where a
 * network call would actually be added — an analytics beacon goes next to a
 * button handler, not next to a colour-space conversion — so a guard that
 * exempts the view layer is a guard aimed away from the risk. Both trees are
 * scanned. Inference dependencies are self-hosted, so there is no runtime host
 * exemption to hide behind.
