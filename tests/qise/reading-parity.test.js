/*
 * THE MIGRATION GATE.
 *
 * `scripts/parity.mjs` produces the evidence. This turns the evidence into a
 * build condition, because a report nobody re-runs is a report that describes
 * the day it was written.
 *
 * The rule is not "all gates pass". It is "the set of failing gates is exactly
 * the set we have written down, with a reason and a fix". A new failure goes
 * red. A fixed blocker ALSO goes red, until someone deletes it from the list —
 * which is how a blocker gets closed instead of quietly living forever.
