/*
 * THE COLLISION AUDIT.
 *
 * READING_EXPERIENCE_CONTRACT.md §2 and §4 are the reason this file exists.
 * The product promise is that materially different interpreted states produce
 * materially different readings. A promise enforced by prose in a design
 * document is not enforced. This is the enforcement.
 *
 * Six ways a build fails here, one per contract clause:
 *
 *   1. a reading-affecting field is never consumed by any component
 *   2. a component reads state the registry did not declare
 *   3. a reachable state produces no reading
 *   4. two materially different states produce the same reading, undeclared
 *   5. a reading-affecting dimension cannot move the output on its own
 *   6. an abstained reading picks up prose that assumes a measurement happened
 *
 * ── WHY THE SWEEP IS EXHAUSTIVE AND NOT SAMPLED ────────────────────────────
 * A sampled sweep finds the collisions that are common and misses the ones in
 * the corners, and the corners are where reading quality actually degrades —
 * the marked movement on a limited-confidence day, the settling trajectory
 * during a lineage variant. The declared space filtered through isReachable()
 * is a five-figure count of cheap string builds. Exhaustive is affordable, so
 * sampled would be a choice to know less for no gain.
