/*
 * THE VARIATION LAYER.
 *
 * Repetition was the one blocker on making the Reflection Engine default: over
 * a simulated year it showed prose the reader had already met on 69% of days,
 * because seeding from the state key — the thing that made collisions
 * detectable — also made a returning state return the same words.
 *
 * The fix must not buy variety with the guarantees. So this file holds the two
 * halves of the promise against each other:
 *
 *   EQUIVALENCE   every variant of one state makes the same claim, at the same
 *                 confidence, with the same relationship to the source, and is
 *                 explained by the same components and causes. Only the framing
 *                 moves.
 *
 *   DISTINCTNESS  no variant of one state is ever the text of another state, at
 *                 any occurrence. The collision guarantee is not weakened by
 *                 variation; it is extended across it.
 *
 * ── WHY AN ODOMETER AND NOT A HASH ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * A hashed pick repeats by the birthday bound: with 648 combinations it is more
 * likely than not to repeat within about thirty occurrences. A mixed-radix
 * walk visits every combination exactly once before any repeat, so
 * non-repetition is a property of the construction rather than a number that
 * happened to come out well on one simulated year.
