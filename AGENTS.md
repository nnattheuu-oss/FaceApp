# Mien Shiang agent entry point

This repository is the source of truth. Do not reconstruct project decisions from chat memory.

Before changing the product, read:

1. `CLAUDE.md` for existing implementation invariants.
2. `docs/PROJECT_CHARTER.md` for product and design constraints.
3. `docs/DECISION_REGISTER.md` to separate facts, approved work and unresolved proposals.
4. `docs/AGENT_OPERATING_MODEL.md` for ownership, handoffs and integration order.
5. The relevant brief under `docs/agents/`.
6. `docs/INTERPRETATION_SYSTEM.md` for scanner-to-reading expansion work.
7. `docs/scanner-development-report.md` for the scanner's evidence and remaining limitations.
8. For approved daily-loop work, `docs/OPTION_B_PROGRAM.md`, `docs/OPTION_B_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` and `docs/agents/daily-loop-program-architect.md`.
9. Before changing any user-facing visual experience, `docs/VISUAL_DIRECTION.md`.
10. For anything touching money, the store build, privacy egress or the paywall, `docs/MONETISATION_AUDIT_2026-09.md` (its frozen contracts bind every agent).

## Non-negotiable workflow

- Work on a task branch and open a pull request; do not commit directly to `main`.
- Do not change a product decision, source interpretation, geometry mapping or validation threshold merely to make a check pass.
- Mark new ideas as proposals until the product owner approves them.
- Treat the current code and tests as evidence of implementation, not proof that every document is current.
- Use en-AU spelling in user-facing copy.
- Raw frames, and every frame the measurement path reads, remain in volatile memory and are not persisted or transmitted. The one narrow exception, amended 9 September 2026 by `DR-2026-09-09-CARDS-1-2-DAILY-PORTRAIT-CHARTER`: a Daily Portrait timeline **display frame** (aligned/cropped/orientation-corrected, per `docs/DAILY_PORTRAIT_ARCHITECTURE.md`) may be persisted once built and consent-gated — it is never the same buffer the measurement path consumes, so this guarantee is otherwise unaffected. See `docs/PROJECT_CHARTER.md` for the full wording.
- The product is entertainment and self-discovery, not diagnosis, identity, attractiveness scoring, prediction or a fixed judgement of character.
- When evidence is missing, abstain or set `needsVerification: true`; never fabricate a MediaPipe index, classical claim, legal conclusion or commercial decision.
- For Option B, programme approval is not signal approval. Follow the execution queue in dependency order; no new transient signal becomes persistent, eligible or user-facing before its contract and independent proof verdict pass.

## Branch discipline (DR-2026-09-25-M0-CONSOLIDATION)

The repository once carried 50+ parallel agent branches; M0 triaged every one. To keep it from recurring:

- **One active branch per workstream**, named for the milestone it serves (`m1a/*`, `m1b/*`, `m1c/*`, `m2/*`, `m3/*`, `docs/*`).
- Branches stack on `main` or on the current release PR, **never more than two layers deep**. A third layer waits until the first merges.
- **Every PR body names the DR entry or milestone that authorises it.** A branch with no authorising record is not opened.
- A branch that stops being worked is merged, or superseded with a note naming what absorbed it, then archived as a tag `archive/<name>` before the branch is deleted. Nothing is deleted silently.

## Required handoff

Every agent handoff must state: task and acceptance criteria; inputs and source versions; files changed; contracts changed; tests and evidence; decisions made; unresolved risks; and the next owner. The Release Gatekeeper must be independent of the Architect.
