/*
 * THE PARITY HARNESS — a migration gate, not a diff.
 *
 * The question "are the two engines the same?" is the wrong one and answering
 * it would be actively harmful: the Reflection Engine is supposed to say more
 * than the passage engine, so string equality would score every intended
 * improvement as a failure and push the corpus back toward what it replaced.
 *
 * The right questions are the four the owner set, and each is answered by a
 * measurement rather than a reading of the output:
 *
 *   COVERAGE        every record the old engine renders, the new one renders.
 *   PRESERVATION    where they differ, nothing the old one carried is lost.
 *   PERSONALISATION the dimensions the old engine collapsed are expressed.
 *   SAFETY          the new engine is never more assertive, less abstaining or
 *                   less traceable than the one it replaces.
 *
 * ── WHY THE LONG RUNS SYNTHESISE AXES INSTEAD OF PAINTING PIXELS ───────────
 * The 30/90/365-day exposure analysis needs hundreds of consecutive readings.
 * Painting and reading a face for each would take minutes and would measure the
 * fixture generator, not the engines. So the base axes come from the real pixel
 * path — real ROI reads, real Lab, real metrics — and the day-to-day drift is
 * synthesised on top. Every reading still passes through the real
 * `interpretReading`, the real baseline, the real compass. The only synthetic
 * part is the weather.
