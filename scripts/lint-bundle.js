/**
 * Post-build compliance lint. Runs against dist/, NOT src/.
 *
 * ── WHY THE ARTEFACT AND NOT THE SOURCE ────────────────────────────────────
 * A term in a file that never ships is not a finding; a term that survives
 * into the deployed bundle is. These three guards are the ones a store review
 * or a regulator would effectively be running, so they run on the same thing
 * a reviewer would download.
 *
 * Three guards, all regression gates rather than one-off checks:
 *   1. copy blocklist   — Module A vocabulary discipline, in the artefact
 *   2. attractiveness   — no rating/rank/score scalar reaches the bundle
 *   3. egress allowlist — every network destination is on the list, and no
 *                         analysis-derived value is ever sent anywhere
 *
 * Exits non-zero on any finding. Exits non-zero on an EMPTY bundle too: a lint
 * that passes because it scanned nothing is the false-green this repo has
 * shipped twice.
