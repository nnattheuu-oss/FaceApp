/*
 * RETENTION / EXHAUSTION SIMULATOR — FOUR SEPARATELY LABELLED ANALYSES.
 *
 * `npm run retention:sim`. PR B cannot validate retention for the completed
 * future product, because its strongest new mechanism — the Daily Portrait
 * timeline — is deliberately not implemented until PR C. Reporting one
 * combined number as "retention validated" would misstate what was actually
 * measured, and it would compound that misstatement if a simulation silently
 * ran under the INTERNAL Reflection Engine configuration and reported it as
 * "current retention".
 *
 * `src/qise/reading-flags.js` makes the split explicit: `off` is the
 * PUBLICLY SHIPPED behaviour, `on` is the development Reflection Engine path,
 * and `defaultMode(hostname)` returns "on" only for a named internal-host
 * allowlist — every other origin, including one the allowlist has never
 * heard of, gets `off`. This script never lets an ambient hostname pick the
 * mode: it runs BOTH `oldReading()` (the shipped passage engine) and
 * `reflectionFor()` (the Reflection Engine) explicitly, on the same
 * synthetic history, and reports them as two separate, named analyses.
 *
 * The four analyses, NEVER collapsed into one verdict:
 *
 *   A. PUBLIC_SHIPPED_RETENTION       — what a public-origin visitor gets today.
 *   B. INTERNAL_REFLECTION_RETENTION  — the development engine path, explicitly
 *                                        not the public default.
 *   C. LATENT_HERITAGE_EXHAUSTION     — heritage depth under hypothetical
 *                                        authorisation via the internal seam.
 *   D. DAILY_PORTRAIT_COMPOUNDING_MODEL — architecture-level projection only;
 *                                        no runtime code exists to execute
 *                                        against, because Daily Portrait is
 *                                        not implemented in this repository.
 *
 * A and B reuse `scripts/lib/reading-simulation.mjs` (the same real-pixel-
 * path primitives `scripts/parity.mjs` uses) for the base capture arithmetic;
 * only the day-to-day "weather" is scenario-specific, and even that follows
 * the same seeded-LCG-determinism discipline `simulateDays()` already
 * established. C reuses `scripts/heritage-readiness.mjs`'s internal seam and
 * (corrected) material-signature functions rather than a second
 * implementation.
