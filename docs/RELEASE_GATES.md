# Release gates

**Two gates. One target. Product-owner direction, 17 August 2026.**

---

## GATE 0 — HUMAN OWNER SMOKE TEST (blocking; owner directive, 25 September 2026)

**Human owner smoke test of merged `main` on a real device is a blocking gate for any store submission; automated tests alone never satisfy it.**

As of 25 September 2026 the owner has never run this app. No manual run of the scanner, the boot flow, the paywall or the readings has happened, on any device. No gate in this file, or in `docs/STORE_RELEASE_GATES.md`, may be marked green on automated evidence alone.

## GATE 1 — FULL PRODUCT (the target)

**Qi Se measurement + personal history + Heritage + Reflection Engine.**

This is the product. Pattern × Co–Star × Mien Shiang, with the scholarly
heritage and reflection layer as the core differentiator — the thing no
competitor in this category can copy without dismantling their own claims.

### Open requirements

| Requirement | State |
|---|---|
| Engine correctness, coverage, traceability, variation | **Closed** — `docs/PARITY_2026-08-17.md`, 10/10 gates |
| Class-A dispositions R1–R14 | **14 of 14 closed** — `DR-2026-08-17-B020-CLASS-A` closed ten; R3, R6, R8 and R9 were approved 9 September 2026 by `DR-2026-09-09-B020-CLASS-BC-R3-R6-R8-R9`, which records the product owner's disposition for each against `docs/OPTION_B_020_DISPOSITIONS.md`. **R8's disposition there (suppress 妻妾宮/奴僕宮) was itself superseded the same day** by `DR-2026-09-09-R8-TWELVE-PALACES-RESTORED`: no suppression list exists in `src/reading/twelve-palaces.js` any more, both names render literally, and only Wealth/Property are withheld — for an unrelated reason (structural source disagreement, not naming). See that entry, not the suppression-list description above, for R8's actual current state. None of this changes any heritage family's `Blocked` commercial-release status. |
| Su Wen edition, designated edition families | **Closed** — `docs/EDITION_DECISIONS.md` |
| Three Sections primary source | **Open** — `docs/ACQUISITION_THREE_SECTIONS.md` |
| Twelve Palaces chapter body | **Open** |
| Corpus ownership determination | **Open** — Track 1, `docs/LEGAL_PARALLEL_TRACK.md` |
| Legal requirement 5 × 6 families | **Open** — Track 2 |
| Evidence hashed into the manifest | **Open** |

### Release condition

All six families `cleared` in `docs/commercial-rights-manifest.json`, verified by
`npm run audit:release`, **and** the public default flipped deliberately in a
recorded decision. Neither alone is sufficient.

## Current recommendation

**Stay on the target product.** The critical path is acquisition of the
remaining required evidence.
