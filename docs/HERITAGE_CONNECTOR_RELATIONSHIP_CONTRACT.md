# D-2 — Heritage connector relationships: root cause, inventory, and the selection contract

Measured on `claude/heritage-connector-relationships-d2`, from `1cd96de`. Every number below
comes from running the production registries and resolver through the internal analytical seam
(`composeHeritageConnectionsWithRegistries()`), never from reading a field name and inferring
what it does.

**This document changes no runtime behaviour.** It records what the constraint actually is and
freezes the contract any expansion must satisfy.

---

## 1. Root cause of connector residue = 1

`scripts/heritage-readiness.mjs`'s `connectorResidue()` returns 1 whenever
`composeLatent(...).active.length <= 1` — "nothing to rotate". Measured, at full latent
authorisation (`captureQualityPassed: true`, `safetyPassed: true`), across all six constructs and
both lineages:

| construct/lineage | active | sourcePanelOnly | abstentions |
|---|---|---|---|
| threeSections/primary | **0** | 0 | 2 |
| fiveElements/primary | **0** | 0 | 2 |
| twelvePalaces/primary | **0** | 0 | 0 |
| fiveMountains/primary | **0** | 0 | 5 |
| **fourRivers/primary** | **1** | 0 | 5 |
| fourRivers/variant | 0 | 1 | 5 |
| fiveOfficers/primary | **0** | 1 | 0 |

`four-rivers-flow-and-banks` is **the only active heritage connector anywhere in the product.**

### The cause is a two-gate conjunction, and the gates are anti-correlated

`active` admission requires `runtimePolicy === "HERITAGE_PRESENTATION_ALLOWED"`
(`resolver.js:1050`, `:1065`, `:1084` — `RESEARCH_ONLY` and `SOURCE_PANEL_ONLY` are both
diverted before the `active.push`). Independently, `classifyRelationshipAvailability()`
(`resolver.js:201-219`) grades a connector `FULLY_AVAILABLE` only when the connector's own
`measurementAvailability` **and** every participant construct-lineage's **and** every
declared `historicalState`'s all classify as `capturable` (`SUPPORTED_2D` or
`CONDITIONALLY_SUPPORTED`).

Cross-tabulating the two over all 15 connector records:

| relationship availability | HERITAGE_PRESENTATION_ALLOWED | SOURCE_PANEL_ONLY | RESEARCH_ONLY |
|---|---|---|---|
| FULLY_AVAILABLE | **0** | 0 | **2** |
| PARTIALLY_AVAILABLE | **0** | **1** | 0 |
| HERITAGE_ONLY | **3** | 0 | 0 |
| UNAVAILABLE_FROM_CAPTURE | 0 | 0 | 9 |

**The diagonal is empty. No connector in the registry is both measurable and authorised.**

- The only two `FULLY_AVAILABLE` connectors — the only two relationships this product can
  actually observe in a front-on photograph — are both `threeSections`, and both are
  `RESEARCH_ONLY`.
- The only three `HERITAGE_PRESENTATION_ALLOWED` connectors are all
  `CAMERA_GEOMETRY_INSUFFICIENT`, so they can only ever be `HERITAGE_ONLY` — attributed
  tradition shown beside the reading, never conditioned on it.

That is the residue of one, stated exactly. Against the six candidate causes:

| candidate cause | verdict |
|---|---|
| 1. only one admitted relationship | **No.** 15 records exist; 11 are diverted by `runtimePolicy`, 1 to a source panel. |
| 2. relationships collapsing during normalisation | **No.** Every record survives to a disposition with a named `gateReason`. |
| 3. conditions never becoming reachable | **Partly** — the `fiveMountains` sub-case only (below). Not the general cause. |
| 4. selection logic discarding valid candidates | **No.** Selection never runs; nothing reaches `active` to be selected among. |
| 5. provenance / availability gates excluding them | **YES — this is the cause.** |
| 6. error in the readiness measurement | **No.** The harness reports `active.length` faithfully; `active` is genuinely 0 or 1. |

### The `fiveMountains` sub-case — a second, independent gate

Two of the three `HERITAGE_PRESENTATION_ALLOWED` connectors
(`five-mountains-mutual-facing`, `five-mountains-fullness`) still never reach `active`, because
the selected lineage carries its own `runtimeStatus`:

| construct/primary lineage | `runtimeStatus` | `measurementAvailability` |
|---|---|---|
| threeSections | `RESEARCH_ONLY` | `SUPPORTED_2D` |
| **fiveMountains** | **`RESEARCH_ONLY`** | `CAMERA_GEOMETRY_INSUFFICIENT` |
| **fourRivers** | **`RUNTIME_PROSE`** | `CAMERA_GEOMETRY_INSUFFICIENT` |
| fiveOfficers | `RUNTIME_PROSE` | `CONDITIONALLY_SUPPORTED` |
| fiveElements | `RUNTIME_PROSE` | `MODERN_MAPPING_UNSUPPORTED` |
| twelvePalaces | `RESEARCH_ONLY` | `CONDITIONALLY_SUPPORTED` |

`fourRivers/primary` is `RUNTIME_PROSE` and `fiveMountains/primary` is not — that single
difference is why exactly one connector is active in the whole product. `fiveMountains` is
CARD 7 (`ABSTRACT_LINEAGE_OVERRIDES` deliberately empty); this is a **withheld decision, not a
defect**, and must not be routed around.

### The third constraint, which is the deepest and was not previously recorded

Both measurable, verified relationships carry **fortune or status predicates in their source
text**:

- `three-sections-facial-proportion-taiqing` — 三停皆稱乃上相之人矣. 上相 is a rank/fortune
  claim.
- `five-officers-one-good-office-ten-years` — 或一官好則貴十年. 貴 is a rank/fortune claim.

The locked product decisions strip longevity, fortune, wealth and character semantics. So the
relationships this product *can* measure are precisely the ones whose classical predicates it is
*forbidden to state*. Promoting either verbatim would breach a locked decision, not merely a
style rule. Any promotion must carry the geometric predicate and abstain from the fortune
clause — which is a content decision, recorded here, not applied.

---

## 2. Relationship inventory

15 connector records. `constructs` is derived from `participants[].constructId`; two records are
concept-only and scope to no construct.

| connector | construct(s) | relType | policy | evidence | measAvail | availability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| three-sections-equality-mayi-received | threeSections | COLLECTIVE_RULE | RESEARCH_ONLY | RECORDED_NOT_VERIFIED | SUPPORTED_2D | FULLY_AVAILABLE |
| three-sections-facial-proportion-taiqing | threeSections | COLLECTIVE_RULE | RESEARCH_ONLY | VERIFIED_PRIMARY | SUPPORTED_2D | FULLY_AVAILABLE |
| five-forms-generative-overcoming-system | fiveElements | COLLECTIVE_RULE | RESEARCH_ONLY | RECORDED_NOT_VERIFIED | MODERN_MAPPING_UNSUPPORTED | UNAVAILABLE |
| five-forms-like-with-like | fiveElements | COLLECTIVE_RULE | RESEARCH_ONLY | VERIFIED_PRIMARY | MODERN_MAPPING_UNSUPPORTED | UNAVAILABLE |
| five-mountains-mutual-facing | fiveMountains | COLLECTIVE_RULE | **HERITAGE_PRESENTATION_ALLOWED** | VERIFIED_PRIMARY | CAMERA_GEOMETRY_INSUFFICIENT | HERITAGE_ONLY |
| five-mountains-fullness | fiveMountains | COLLECTIVE_RULE | **HERITAGE_PRESENTATION_ALLOWED** | VERIFIED_PRIMARY | CAMERA_GEOMETRY_INSUFFICIENT | HERITAGE_ONLY |
| **four-rivers-flow-and-banks** | fourRivers | COLLECTIVE_RULE | **HERITAGE_PRESENTATION_ALLOWED** | VERIFIED_PRIMARY | CAMERA_GEOMETRY_INSUFFICIENT | **HERITAGE_ONLY — the one active** |
| four-rivers-mutual-facing | fourRivers | COLLECTIVE_RULE | RESEARCH_ONLY | VERIFIED_PRIMARY | CAMERA_GEOMETRY_INSUFFICIENT | UNAVAILABLE |
| four-rivers-shen-corresponds | fourRivers | CORRESPONDS_TO | RESEARCH_ONLY | VERIFIED_PRIMARY | UNMEASURABLE | UNAVAILABLE |
| five-mountains-four-rivers-corresponds | fiveMountains+fourRivers | CORRESPONDS_TO | RESEARCH_ONLY | VERIFIED_PRIMARY | CAMERA_GEOMETRY_INSUFFICIENT | UNAVAILABLE |
| heritage-qise-modifies-form-shen-mountains-rivers | fiveMountains+fourRivers | MODIFIES | RESEARCH_ONLY | VERIFIED_PRIMARY | CAMERA_GEOMETRY_INSUFFICIENT | UNAVAILABLE |
| yuebo-mountains-rivers-form-shen-configuration | fiveMountains+fourRivers | CONJUNCTIVE_CONFIGURATION | RESEARCH_ONLY | VERIFIED_PRIMARY | CAMERA_GEOMETRY_INSUFFICIENT | UNAVAILABLE |
| five-officers-one-good-office-ten-years | fiveOfficers | COLLECTIVE_RULE | SOURCE_PANEL_ONLY | VERIFIED_PRIMARY | NOT_RECORDED | PARTIALLY_AVAILABLE |
| shen-requires-form | (concept-only) | REQUIRES | RESEARCH_ONLY | RECORDED_NOT_VERIFIED | UNMEASURABLE | UNAVAILABLE |
| form-requires-shen | (concept-only) | REQUIRES | RESEARCH_ONLY | RECORDED_NOT_VERIFIED | UNMEASURABLE | UNAVAILABLE |

`twelvePalaces` has **zero** connector records of its own.
`prohibitedForUserInference` is `true` on all 15 — that is **required** (`resolver.js:941`
requires it as `lockOk`), not a blocker.

### Per-construct counts

| construct | records | HERITAGE_PRESENTATION_ALLOWED | measurable (FULLY/PARTIALLY) | currently active |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| threeSections | 2 | 0 | **2** | 0 |
| fiveElements | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| twelvePalaces | **0** | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| fiveMountains | 5 | 2 | 0 | 0 |
| fourRivers | 6 | 1 | 0 | **1** |
| fiveOfficers | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |

### The one legitimate expansion the corpus already supports

`three-sections-predicate` (disagreement registry, `nature: PREDICATE`, `status: OPEN`) records
**two byte-pinned positions that assert different geometric predicates about the same measurable
construct**:

| position | source | predicate | locator |
|---|---|---|---|
| `taiqing-xiangcheng` | 太清神鑑 | **相稱** — the sections are *in proportion / mutually matching* | 卷一, 卷五, 卷六 — three internal byte-pinned witnesses |
| `yuguan-pingdeng` | 玉管照神局 | **平等** — the sections are *equal* | 卷下, `<pb:KR3g0044_WYG_003_13a>` |

"In proportion to one another" and "equal in length" are **not the same geometric claim**, and
`threeSections` is the one construct whose geometry is `SUPPORTED_2D`. This is a genuine,
source-attested, measurable relationship disagreement — the strongest legitimate candidate for
connector depth in the corpus, and it requires no new source acquisition.

`three-sections-boundaries` (`nature: MAPPING`, 4 positions) is weaker: `common-transmitted`
cites `mianxiang-unspecified` (no identified source) and `received-mayi-contradiction` records a
contradicted attribution. Treat as evidence, not as promotable positions.

---

## 3. The frozen D-2 selection contract

Any implementation of connector depth must satisfy every clause. These are constraints, not
suggestions; each exists because violating it produces a specific, named failure.

### C1 — Only heritage axes may select a relationship

`RESOLVER_DEPENDS_ON` stays `["heritageConstruct", "sourceLineage"]`. **No reading-state
measurement field — `region`, `direction`, `magnitudeBand`, `confidenceBand`, `historyStage`,
`trajectory`, `ascendant` — may select, rank, filter or weight a connector.** A connector
selected by measurement state is a measurement-conditioned heritage claim, which is exactly what
`prohibitedForUserInference: true` forbids and what the measurement/heritage separation exists to
prevent.

### C2 — Measurement state may affect presentation only, and only downstream

Tier 2 may place the reader's own record beside the heritage passage (D-1's `personalContext`)
and may state that a construct's geometry was or was not measurable today. It may **not** use
that to choose which relationship is shown.

### C3 — Several relationships qualify → deterministic rotation over the eligible set

Rotation is the existing coprime-stride walk over `renderPlan.relationshipOrder`
(`resolver.js:110-125`), seeded by `occurrence`. No `Math.random()`, no timestamp, no hostname.
Connector residue is then the count of genuinely eligible relationships and nothing else —
which is what makes the residue an honest measure of library depth rather than of template
count.

### C4 — No relationship qualifies → an honest no-match, never a substitute

The composition returns its existing abstention with a `reasonCode`. Tier 2 states that no
source-attested relationship is available for this construct today. It must not fall back to a
different construct, a weaker record, or generic prose.

### C5 — Lineage disagreement stays visible

Where two positions disagree (`three-sections-predicate`, `four-rivers-eye-mouth`), both are
carried and the disagreement is named. A disagreement is never silently resolved to a house
position, and rotation between two disagreeing positions is **not** a substitute for saying they
disagree.

### C6 — Provenance survives into the composed output

Every rendered relationship carries `sourceId`, locator, `evidenceStrength`, `textualLayer` and
`citationStatus` through to the reader-visible surface, as `heritage-view.js`'s
`connectorEvidenceCard` already does. A relationship whose provenance cannot travel is not
eligible.

### C7 — Abstention prevents unsupported composition

`measurementAvailability` gates what may be *asserted*, independently of what may be *shown*. A
`CAMERA_GEOMETRY_INSUFFICIENT` relationship may be presented as attributed tradition
(`HERITAGE_ONLY`) and may never be presented as observed in this photograph.

### C8 — Deterministic replay

Same state, same occurrence, same registries → byte-identical composition. Pinned in the same
style as D-1's determinism test.

### C9 — The predicate a connector renders must be one the product may state

The fortune/status clause of a source passage (上相, 貴, longevity, wealth, character) is
excluded from reader-facing predicates even when the surrounding relationship is verified and
measurable. Carrying the geometric predicate while abstaining from the fortune clause is
permitted and must be explicit in the record; silently rendering the whole passage is not.

### Prohibited routes to Gate D

Synonyms; template multiplication; changing variant rotation; restating personal context;
manufactured combinations; state labels creating artificial uniqueness; lowering
`evidenceStrength` or `measurementAvailability` thresholds; routing around CARD 7 or CARD 10.
**Connector residue above 1 counts only when it comes from genuine, independently source-attested
relationship records.**

---

## 4. What this means for Gate D

Gate D's `DIVERSITY_TARGET` is 250. If the single strongest legitimate expansion were approved
and implemented in full — both `three-sections-predicate` positions promoted, `threeSections`
routed to `RUNTIME_PROSE` — the connector residue for `threeSections/primary` would be **2**, and
combined material would rise from 24 to roughly 48 against a prose period of 72.

**Gate D would still fail, and should.** The corpus does not contain 250 distinct, verified,
measurable, presentable relationships, and no legitimate amount of engineering produces them.
Reaching 250 requires source acquisition and rights clearance, not code.

The honest position: **connector depth is bounded by the evidence corpus and by what a
front-on photograph can observe, and both bounds are far below the current target.** Either the
target is revised against what the corpus can support, or the corpus is expanded first. That is
a product-owner decision and is recorded here, not taken.

---

## 5. Decisions taken (DR-2026-08-31-D2-CONNECTOR-PREDICATE)

D2-1 approved (must land with D2-2). D2-2 approved with enforcement. D2-3 approved with exactly
**two** records, not three. D2-4 hold the target — Gate D stays at 250, `NOT_READY` accepted,
passing the gate is not authorised.

The original §5 decision list is superseded; see the register entry for the binding wording.

---

## 6. The field-flow trace, and why D2-2 needs a bounded freeze exception

D2-2 requires that `excludedPredicateClauses` be *consumed or otherwise enforced by the
reader-facing path*, and that a project-owned translation of the geometric predicate be
exposed. Tracing that requirement against the real code produces a blocker that must be
recorded rather than routed around.

### 6.1 Neither field can reach a reader today, and two allow-lists are why

```
connector record            src/heritage/registry.js          editable
  -> toResolvedEntry()      src/heritage/resolver.js:754      FROZEN   <-- blocked
    -> connectorCard()      src/ui/qise/heritage-view.js:147  editable <-- also blocked
      -> heritageConnectorTier2Markup / Tier3Markup           -> reader
```

Both stages are **explicit field allow-lists**, not spreads — deliberately, and the design is
correct:

- `toResolvedEntry()` copies exactly 20 named fields off the connector. `relationshipPredicate`
  is **not** among them, and neither is any translation or exclusion field. Everything else on the
  record is dropped at this boundary.
- `connectorCard()` reduces further to 9 fields — `connectorId`, `relationshipLabel`,
  `participants`, `relationshipDirection`, `sourceId`, `sourceTitle`, `sectionLocator`,
  `disposition`, `prohibitedForUserInference`. `connectorEvidenceCard()` (Tier 3) spreads that
  base and adds 8 evidence fields; still no predicate.

So a connector's `relationshipPredicate` is invisible to every reader-facing surface, and adding
`excludedPredicateClauses` to the registry alone would be exactly the "unused metadata" D2-2
explicitly rejects. **The first allow-list that must change is in a frozen file.**

### 6.2 Two records differing only in source are not the distinction D2-3 asks for

Without the predicate, the two Three Sections records differ to a reader only by `sourceId`,
`sourceTitle` and `sectionLocator` — the reader sees *two different sources*, never *two
different claims*. D2-3 requires "a meaningful proportion/equality distinction in the permitted
surface". 相稱 (in proportion) versus 平等 (equal) is that distinction, and it cannot be shown
while the predicate stops at `toResolvedEntry()`.

### 6.3 Where project-owned translations actually live — and why the connector has none

Translation is an established, validated contract, but it exists **only on lineage records**:

| field | on | purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `definition` | lineage | the project-owned English prose; `heritageMaterialFor()` renders it as Tier 2's passage |
| `translationProvenance` | lineage | `PROJECT_ORIGINAL` / `PUBLIC_DOMAIN_TRANSLATION` / `NOT_TRANSLATED_HERITAGE_ONLY`, validated at `validator.js:370,380` |
| `translationAgentId` | lineage | who produced it |

**Connector records carry no translation field of any kind.** They hold `sourceText` (Han),
`note` (an English research note, not reader copy), and — proposed — `relationshipPredicate`
(Han). There is therefore no existing verified path by which an English rendering of 相稱 or
平等 could reach a reader, and none may be invented in an execution handoff.

### 6.4 `englishSafe()` blocks Han, and does not block an English fortune claim

`heritage-view.js`'s `englishSafe()` omits any string containing a Han character, whole, with a
deliberate no-fragment policy: *"a surgically-edited fragment is not a verified translation, it
is a guess with the evidence removed."*

That gives D2-2 half its enforcement for free — 上相 and 貴 are Han, so they can never survive
`englishSafe()` into a reader-facing field. **It gives none of the other half.** D2-2 also bans
"any English rank, status or fortune interpretation", and a project-owned English translation
reading *"a person of superior physiognomy"* would pass `englishSafe()` untouched. A second,
English-vocabulary guard on the translation field is therefore required, not optional.

### 6.5 The smallest explicit architecture exception — PROPOSED, NOT APPROVED

Minimal change set, in dependency order. It reuses the existing validated translation contract
rather than inventing a second one.

1. **`src/heritage/connectors.js`** — three optional fields on `HERITAGE_CONNECTOR_FIELDS`:
   `relationshipPredicate` (already present), `predicateTranslation` (project-owned English),
   `excludedPredicateClauses` (array of excluded source clauses, audit-only, never rendered), and
   reuse of the existing `HERITAGE_TRANSLATION_PROVENANCE` enum for a
   `predicateTranslationProvenance`. **No new enum.**
2. **`src/heritage/resolver.js:754` `toResolvedEntry()` — the freeze exception.** Add exactly two
   pass-through entries, `predicateTranslation` and `excludedPredicateClauses`. No logic change,
   no new branch, no effect on disposition, ordering or selection.
3. **`src/ui/qise/heritage-view.js` `connectorCard()`** — add `predicateTranslation` to the
   allow-list, passed through `englishSafe()` **and** a new `fortuneFree()` guard that omits the
   value if it carries rank/status/fortune vocabulary. `excludedPredicateClauses` is deliberately
   **not** added: it is audit metadata whose enforcement is the guard, and rendering the list of
   things withheld would reintroduce the very clause it excludes.

Step 2 is a Stage 1/2 freeze exception. Under this document's own §3 rules an
`ARCHITECTURE_AFFECTING` change stops and becomes a decision card rather than being smuggled in,
so **it is proposed here and is not authorised.** It is the narrowest form available: two
pass-through fields in one object literal, adding no behaviour to the resolver.

If the product owner declines the exception, D2-2's enforcement clause cannot be satisfied, and
therefore D2-1 (which must land with D2-2) and D2-3's "meaningful distinction" requirement cannot
be satisfied either. The honest fallback is to leave all three unimplemented rather than ship
`excludedPredicateClauses` as unused metadata.

---

## 7. Superseded — original decision list

| # | Decision | Blocking |
|---|---|---|
| D2-1 | Promote `three-sections-facial-proportion-taiqing` from `RESEARCH_ONLY`, and route `threeSections/primary` to `RUNTIME_PROSE`? | The only measurable+verified relationship available. |
| D2-2 | May a promoted connector carry the geometric predicate while abstaining from the fortune clause (C9)? | Both measurable relationships carry 上相 / 貴. |
| D2-3 | Split `three-sections-predicate`'s two positions into two connector records? | The only genuine source of residue > 1. |
| D2-4 | Revise Gate D's target against corpus capacity, or hold it and accept indefinite `NOT_READY`? | Gate D is currently unreachable by legitimate means. |

None is taken here. CARD 7 (`fiveMountains` routing) and CARD 10 (`twelvePalaces`) remain open
and untouched.

---

## 8. IMPLEMENTED — DR-2026-08-31-D2-CONNECTOR-PREDICATE, D2-1/D2-2 (single-connector scope)

The product owner approved D2-1 through D2-4 with two corrections to how D2-1 is realised, and
this section records what was actually built, superseding §6.5's proposal where they differ.

### 8.1 The lineage decision — routed, not promoted

D2-1's original wording ("route `threeSections/primary` to `RUNTIME_PROSE`") would have promoted
the CONTESTED received-Ma-Yi lineage — the literal `"primary"` registry key — whose own
`definition` ends "...the reading is auspicious," a fortune claim D2-2 bans. The corrected
instruction: **use the verified Taiqing lineage for active presentation; keep the Ma Yi lineage
untouched and never promoted.**

Implemented via `ABSTRACT_LINEAGE_OVERRIDES.threeSections = { primary: "taiqing-mianbu-facial" }`
in `src/heritage/composition.js` — the exact mechanism this file already reserved for a
product-owner lineage-routing decision (see item 43/CARD 7's discussion). This affects **only**
the connector-resolution path. `heritageMaterialFor()` (`src/qise/reflection.js`), which renders
Tier 2's PASSAGE, does its own direct `lineages[state.sourceLineage]` lookup and has never
consulted this map — confirmed by tracing the function, not assumed — so the passage for
`threeSections/primary` continues to read the literal `"primary"` key (Ma Yi, still
`RESEARCH_ONLY`) and continues to abstain exactly as before. Pinned by
`tests/heritage/three-sections-predicate-acceptance.test.js`'s
`"the passage layer (heritageMaterialFor) is untouched and still abstains..."`.

`taiqing-mianbu-facial`'s own `runtimeStatus` moved `RESEARCH_ONLY` → `HERITAGE_ONLY` (not
`RUNTIME_PROSE`): its `definition` field still embeds Han fortune-adjacent terms verbatim as
citation evidence, and `RUNTIME_PROSE` would make it a fallback passage candidate. `HERITAGE_ONLY`
un-gates the connector-resolution `applicableLineageRestriction` check (resolver.js's
`resolveLineageRestriction`) without ever making this lineage eligible to render as a passage.

### 8.2 The frozen-file exception — narrower than §6.5 proposed

Approved: a bounded `resolver.js` exception for **exactly** `relationshipPredicate` and
`excludedPredicateClauses`, and nothing else. §6.5's three-step proposal (which included a new
`predicateTranslation` field, a `predicateTranslationProvenance` field reusing
`HERITAGE_TRANSLATION_PROVENANCE`, and additions to `connectors.js`) was **not** approved and was
**not** built. What was actually implemented is narrower:

- `resolver.js`'s `toResolvedEntry()` gained exactly two pass-through lines. No other line changed.
- `connectors.js`, `schema.js`, `validator.js` are **untouched** — confirmed by a test that diffs
  them and fails if any contains the string `excludedPredicateClauses`. This was possible because
  `validateFields()` (validator.js) checks only the fields a manifest declares and does not reject
  undeclared ones — confirmed by reading it, not assumed — so `excludedPredicateClauses` carries
  safely as connector-record content in `registry.js` without a schema declaration.
- No `predicateTranslation` field exists anywhere. No translation was invented for 相稱, 平等,
  上相 or 貴. The connector's `relationshipPredicate` (`"相稱"`, Han) is carried through, but with
  no translation field authorised, `connectorCard()`'s `predicate` output is honestly `null` today
  — proven to be "abstained", not "unused metadata", by feeding `connectorCard()` synthetic safe
  and unsafe predicate values and confirming each is handled correctly (see the acceptance test's
  `"the card layer consumes relationshipPredicate through two independent guards"`).

### 8.3 The enforcement guard — `fortuneFree()`, and what it caught live

`src/ui/qise/heritage-view.js` gained `fortuneFree(value, excludedClauses)`, consumed in
`connectorCard()` (on `relationshipPredicate`, after `englishSafe()`) and in
`disagreementPositionCard()` (on disagreement position `summary` text). Two independent gates,
because they guard different things: `englishSafe()` removes Han script whole; `fortuneFree()`
removes claim-shaped English and anything matching the connector's own `excludedPredicateClauses`
— the half `englishSafe()` cannot cover, since a hypothetical translation reading "a person of
superior physiognomy" contains no Han character at all.

**A real leak was found and fixed while building this, not merely anticipated.** Activating the
Taiqing connector made `threeSections`' disagreements reachable for the first time (disagreements
attach to a CONSTRUCT, not to a specific connector — resolver.js's `collectDisagreementIds` — so
they are pulled in regardless of which connector is active). One position's summary,
`three-sections-boundaries`' `received-mayi-contradiction`, reads "Received Ma Yi witness
contradicts attributed auspiciousness predicate" — pure English, no Han, so it passed
`englishSafe()` untouched and rendered live in Tier 3 markup. The word "auspiciousness" has no
word boundary before "ness", so a `\bauspicious\b`-anchored pattern missed it. Fixed by dropping
the boundary (`auspicious` as a bare substring) and applying `fortuneFree()` to disagreement
position summaries as well as connector predicates. Confirmed fixed by re-rendering the actual
markup, not by re-running the regex in isolation.

The vocabulary is **claim-shaped, not category-shaped** — see item 22/40's class of mistake in
CLAUDE.md. An early version banning the bare words "fortune"/"status"/"rank" fired on this
product's own refusal copy ("it remains fortune-typed heritage and is never encoded as a user
inference"). That string is now the guard's own pinned negative control.

### 8.4 Ma Yi — left exactly where it was, not promoted to a source panel

The instruction's "keep the contested Ma Yi lineage source-panel-only... unless its provenance,
attribution and wording are independently safe and explicitly approved" was read as: no such
independent review has happened in this pass, so the Ma Yi connector
(`three-sections-equality-mayi-received`) and its lineage are **untouched** — still
`RESEARCH_ONLY` at both levels, exactly as before. This is the more conservative reading:
literally promoting the connector's `runtimePolicy` to `SOURCE_PANEL_ONLY` would itself be the
kind of `PRODUCT_POLICY_AFFECTING` content decision the evidence-reconciliation discipline
requires its own explicit, justified ledger row for, and the record's own embedded note already
calls it "Research-only" as an editorial judgement this pass does not have grounds to overturn.
If the product owner wants Ma Yi's material visible in a Tier 3 source panel specifically, that is
a distinct, separate decision, not a side effect of D2-1/D2-2.

### 8.5 Scope: one connector, not two (superseded by §8.7 — D2-3 is now implemented)

D2-3's full scope (exactly two Three Sections predicate records: update Taiqing in place, add one
new `three-sections-pingdeng-yuguan`) is **not completed in this pass**. The instruction for this
round asked for exactly one verified Taiqing connector, activated, with the predicate field-flow
proven end to end — not the second (Yuguan/平等) record. `AUTHORISED_ACTIVE_TAIQING_ID` in the
acceptance test names the one connector this pass activates. Splitting the
`three-sections-predicate` disagreement into its second connector remains future work under the
same decision; both positions are still recorded in the disagreement registry and remain visible
as such (with `englishSafe()`/`fortuneFree()`-filtered fallbacks) via Tier 3's disagreement panel,
independent of whether a second connector exists.

### 8.6 Measured result

Cross-tabulation, corpus size still 15 records, no record added or removed:

| relationship availability | HERITAGE_PRESENTATION_ALLOWED | SOURCE_PANEL_ONLY | RESEARCH_ONLY |
|---|---|---|---|
| FULLY_AVAILABLE | 0 | 0 | **1** |
| PARTIALLY_AVAILABLE | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| HERITAGE_ONLY | 3 | 0 | 0 |
| UNAVAILABLE_FROM_CAPTURE | 0 | 0 | 9 |
| **FULLY_AVAILABLE** | **1 (Taiqing, new)** | — | — |

Active connectors anywhere in the product: **two** —
`fourRivers/primary:four-rivers-flow-and-banks` (unchanged) and
`threeSections/primary:three-sections-facial-proportion-taiqing` (new).

`threeSections/primary` connector residue: **still 1** — one active candidate, nothing to rotate
against, exactly per `connectorResidue()`'s own definition. `heritage:readiness`'s
`heritage(Tier2) raw/material` for `threeSections/primary` is unchanged at `1/1` — the COUNT of
distinct states cannot move with only one candidate, though the CONTENT of that one state changed
qualitatively, from an abstained placeholder to an actual attributed connector. Gate D
(`DIVERSITY_TARGET = 250`) is untouched and still fails; `NOT_READY` is unchanged; `retention:sim`
still reports `NO_ROTATION_OBSERVED_IN_THIS_SCENARIO` for every construct including
`threeSections`, for the same reason. **This is the honest result, not a shortfall to be
corrected here** — per D2-4, passing Gate D was never in scope for this pass.

Verification, this commit: `node --test` 1261/1261 (was 1246); `npm run build`,
`npm run lint:bundle`, `npm run audit:release`, `npm run heritage:readiness`,
`npm run retention:sim` all exit 0; the local `npm run test:browser` sandbox failure is the same
pre-existing Chromium 1194 vs pinned 1234 mismatch (confirmed unrelated by re-running against the
installed binary: 11/11 pass).

## 8.7 D2-3 IMPLEMENTED — the second, independently-evidenced connector

D2-3 authorises exactly two Three Sections predicate records, never three
(docs/DECISION_REGISTER.md's D2-3 entry). §8.5 above described the scope as not yet
completed; this section supersedes that — the second record now exists.

### 8.7.1 What was added

`three-sections-pingdeng-yuguan` — `registry.js`, following
`docs/agents/D2_GEMINI_HANDOFF.md` Task 2b's field-by-field spec verbatim:

| field | value |
|---|---|
| `relationshipPredicate` | `平等` |
| `excludedPredicateClauses` | `["和美"]` |
| `sourceId` | `heritage-three-sections-yuguan` |
| `sourceText` | `三停平等能和美` (copied from `evidence.js`'s `yuguan-pingdeng` lineage record, not retyped) |
| `sectionLocator` / `folioLocator` | `卷下` / `<pb:KR3g0044_WYG_003_13a>`, both `VERIFIED` |
| `measurementAvailability` | `SUPPORTED_2D` |
| `runtimePolicy` | `HERITAGE_PRESENTATION_ALLOWED` |
| `alternateConnectorIds` | `["three-sections-facial-proportion-taiqing"]` |
| `disagreementIds` | `["three-sections-predicate"]` |

`heritage-three-sections-yuguan` (`SOURCE_REGISTRY`) is a genuinely independent,
byte-pinned, `VERIFIED_PRIMARY` witness: 玉管照神局 卷下, a Southern Tang/early Song Siku
text. It is not a Ma Yi witness and not the same juan as the Taiqing facial material — its
own authorship note already states "平等 here is NOT a Ming/麻衣-exclusive predicate".
Activating it neither touches nor depends on the still-`RESEARCH_ONLY` Ma Yi
connector/lineage.

The exclusion follows the same reasoning D2-2 applied to Taiqing's `上相`: the verse's
consequence-clause `能和美` ("[this] can bring harmony and beauty") is an aesthetic/
desirability claim about the person, structurally the same shape as `乃上相之人矣`. It is
named in `excludedPredicateClauses`, never rendered, and (like `相稱`) no English
translation has been authored for `平等` either, so `englishSafe()` omits it whole and the
card's `predicate` is honestly `null` today — same honest-abstention behaviour as the
Taiqing record, not a regression.

The existing Taiqing record gained two explicitly-declared fields per the decision register
(`disagreementIds: ["three-sections-predicate"]`, `alternateConnectorIds:
["three-sections-pingdeng-yuguan"]`) — not load-bearing for reachability
(`collectDisagreementIds()` already attaches any CONSTRUCT-targeted disagreement to every
candidate for that construct regardless of this field) but required to be declared, not
merely achieved implicitly.

### 8.7.2 Measured through the production composition seam

Both connectors reach `ACTIVE` disposition with `relationshipAvailability: "HERITAGE_ONLY"`,
because both are scoped to the `threeSections` construct and therefore inherit the identical
ceiling from the one SELECTED (routed) lineage — `resolveLineageRestriction()` applies
uniformly to every candidate for a construct, never per-connector:

```
composeLatent({ heritageConstruct: "threeSections", sourceLineage: "primary", occurrence: 0 }).active
  -> [three-sections-facial-proportion-taiqing (相稱, HERITAGE_ONLY, ACTIVE),
      three-sections-pingdeng-yuguan (平等, HERITAGE_ONLY, ACTIVE)]
```

`connectorResidue("threeSections", "primary")` moves from `{residue: 1, activeCount: 1,
derivedFrom: "single-or-zero-candidate"}` to `{residue: 2, activeCount: 2, derivedFrom:
"walked 64 occurrences, exact repeat found"}` — matching the decision register's explicit
"active count and connector residue must be exactly 2, not 3" requirement.

Tier 2's deterministic rotation (`renderPlan.relationshipOrder`) genuinely alternates
between the two now that there are two real candidates — checked at occurrences 0-7, both
connectors are reached (Yuguan at even occurrences, Taiqing at odd, in this measurement;
`rotateDeterministically`'s offset/stride are seeded from the construct/lineage/depthMode,
not hand-picked). This is the first construct in the corpus where Tier 2's "shows at most
one" selection is doing real work rather than trivially returning the only candidate.

The `three-sections-predicate` disagreement (相稱 vs 平等, `status: "OPEN"`) is now
genuinely surfaced by two separate active connectors — both `composed.active` entries carry
`disagreementIds: ["three-sections-boundaries", "three-sections-predicate"]` — rather than
being recorded in the registry with no corresponding presentation. Confirmed against the
live composition, not asserted from the registry alone.

**No leak, checked directly against rendered markup**, both at occurrence 0 (Tier 2 picks
Yuguan) and occurrence 1 (Tier 2 picks Taiqing): `connectorCard()` returns `predicate: null`
for both connectors (no translation exists for either 相稱 or 平等); the combined Tier 2 +
Tier 3 markup and JSON models contain no Han rank/status match
(`/[上]相|貴|富貴|壽/`) and no claim-shaped English match, across both occurrences.

### 8.7.3 Re-measured corpus and gate state

Connector identity: **16 total** (was 15), 0 exact-`sourceText` collisions —
`heritage-three-sections-yuguan`'s `三停平等能和美` does not collide with
`heritage-three-sections-taiqing-mianbu`'s `三停皆稱乃上相之人矣`.

Cross-tabulation cell `FULLY_AVAILABLE|HERITAGE_PRESENTATION_ALLOWED` moves from **1 to 2**
(the Yuguan connector's own participant/measurement signals classify identically to
Taiqing's, before the lineage-restriction ceiling is folded in); every other cell is
unchanged.

`threeSections/primary`: `heritage(Tier2) raw/material` moves from `1/1` to `2/2`;
`heritage(Tier3) raw/material` moves from `1/1` to `2/2`; `combined(base+Tier2) raw/material`
moves from `24/24` to **`48/48`** (`prose period=72`, `connector residue=2`,
`combined=LCM(72,2)=72`, all 72 evaluated exhaustively).

`retention:sim`'s `LATENT_HERITAGE_EXHAUSTION` analysis, previously
`NO_ROTATION_OBSERVED_IN_THIS_SCENARIO` for every construct including `threeSections`, now
reports `threeSections (mostlySteady/365d calendar): EXHAUSTED_BY_CALENDAR_DAY_18 (61 days
on rotation, 2 distinct presentations seen)` — the first real, non-trivial exhaustion
measurement in the corpus. It is exhausted almost immediately in a realistic usage
scenario, which is the honest content-depth finding, not evidence Gate D is close: **Gate D
(`DIVERSITY_TARGET = 250`) stays untouched and still fails; `NOT_READY` is unchanged** — the
new high-water mark for connector residue across all six constructs is 2, still three orders
of magnitude below 250. Per D2-4, passing Gate D was never in scope for this pass, and this
result does not move it.

### 8.7.4 Ma Yi, unaffected

The Ma Yi connector (`three-sections-equality-mayi-received`) and its lineage
(`threeSections.lineages.primary`) are untouched by this section — still `RESEARCH_ONLY` at
both levels, never active, never in the source panel. D2-3 activates a second connector
under an EXISTING lineage route (`taiqing-mianbu-facial`, established by D2-1); it creates
no new lineage route and touches no Ma Yi field. §8.4's reasoning for leaving Ma Yi alone is
unchanged by this section.

### 8.7.5 Verification, this commit

`node --test` **1262/1262** (was 1261); `npm run build`, `npm run lint:bundle`,
`npm run audit:release` (exit 0; reports pre-existing `BLOCKED` content-rights items
unrelated to the heritage connector graph, unchanged by this diff), `npm run
heritage:readiness` (exit 0, `NOT_READY` unchanged), `npm run retention:sim` (exit 0) all
pass. The local `npm run test:browser` sandbox failure is the same pre-existing Chromium
1194 vs pinned 1234 mismatch as D-1/D-2 (confirmed unrelated by re-running the same 10 specs
against the installed binary directly with an explicit `executablePath` override: 10/10
pass).
