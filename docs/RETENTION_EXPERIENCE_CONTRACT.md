# Retention experience contract

**Status: product-owner direction, 30 August 2026, implementing `docs/PRODUCT_NORTH_STAR.md`.**
This is the contract every retention mechanism — existing or proposed — is checked against. It
does not itself measure whether the product currently meets it; `docs/HERITAGE_LIBRARY_READINESS.md`
carries the measured result for the heritage dimension, and the four-analysis retention simulation
it reports on is a separate, dated measurement, not part of this contract.

## The core retention rule

A return to the product is legitimate — worth the user's time, and worth counting as a good
outcome for the product — only if it does **at least one** of the following real things:

1. adds a new real frame to the user's visual history;
2. reveals a changed self-relative measurement (Qi Se, against the user's own baseline only);
3. extends an existing trajectory (a pattern visible across several readings, not one);
4. establishes a more reliable personal baseline (more history behind Qi Se's own comparison);
5. gives richer historical context because more history now exists (a then/now comparison, a
   longer flick-book, a year-in-review — only possible once enough real frames exist);
6. exposes a genuinely different heritage relationship, witness, or disagreement the user has not
   seen before, drawn from real source-attested material (`docs/HERITAGE_LIBRARY_READINESS.md`);
7. provides a meaningful steady-state observation — see "Steady days" below, because "nothing
   changed" is itself sometimes the honest and useful thing to say;
8. lets the user view their accumulated timeline in a way they could not before (a new playback
   mode operating on real, growing data — never a mode that requires more history than exists).

This list maps to `docs/PRODUCT_INVARIANTS.md`: item 2 is I3 (history materially affects
readings); item 6 is I7 (heritage passages do not mutate merely for variety — the rotation must be
a genuinely different relationship, not a reshuffled presentation of the same one); item 3 and 4
depend on I1/I2 holding (materially different states read as materially different, returning
states get meaning-preserving variation, not cosmetic variation mistaken for it).

## Prohibited retention mechanics

None of the following may ship, in any tier, on any surface:

- streak loss or "don't break your streak" framing;
- fear-based urgency ("your reading expires", "last chance");
- loot-box or randomised-reward mechanics of any kind;
- fabricated scarcity ("only available today");
- manipulative countdowns;
- shame, guilt, or any negative framing for a missed day.

**This list is a design constraint, not a vocabulary ban.** This document, and the tests that
enforce it once there is a real reader-facing surface to scan (Daily Portrait UI copy, landed in
PR C), must be able to name "streak" and "countdown" to explain why they are prohibited, and a
test fixture may need to construct one to prove a guard actually fires. A repository-wide
banned-word scan would therefore fail this very document. The correct enforcement, when built, is
scoped to production UI/copy registries and reader-facing strings only, with documentation, design
notes and test fixtures explicitly exempted — and it tests **behaviour** (does the product treat a
missed day as a failure state, visually or textually?), not the mere absence of a word from a
markdown file.

**No-notification direction is preserved.** The product does not push notifications to remind,
nag, or re-engage. This retention program does not reopen that decision; if it is reopened, that
is a separate, explicit product-owner decision recorded in `docs/DECISION_REGISTER.md`, not an
inference from anything in this document.

## A missed day is a gap, not a failure

The visual record may have gaps. A gap is simply the honest state of the data — the user did not
capture that day. The product must never:

- interpolate a fake photograph for a missing day;
- AI-generate a face to fill a gap;
- morph between the two real photographs on either side of a gap to fabricate a frame that never
  existed;
- present a gap with language implying the user did something wrong.

Playback (flip, scrub, year timelapse) may visually **traverse** a gap — moving from the last real
frame before it to the first real frame after — but the underlying data always preserves the gap
as a gap, and no synthetic frame is ever generated, stored, or counted as if real. See
`docs/DAILY_PORTRAIT_ARCHITECTURE.md` for the exact data-model expression of this rule.

## Milestones are unlocked capabilities, not badges

Day 1, 7, 30, 90, 180, 365 and multi-year use are not rewarded with a badge, a checkmark, or
congratulatory copy for its own sake. Each is meaningful only because enough real history now
exists to support a **new capability that did not exist before**:

| Milestone | What becomes possible, because it is now true |
|---|---|
| Day 1 | The timeline exists. Qi Se begins forming a baseline. Heritage is shown once, honestly labelled as the first of an ongoing rotation. |
| Day 7 | A one-week flick-book is watchable. Qi Se can begin to speak to a very short trajectory, cautiously. |
| Day 30 | A month flick-book. Qi Se's baseline is materially more reliable (`historyStageOf` in `src/qise/reading-state.js` already distinguishes `calibrating`/`establishing`/`established`). The heritage rotation has cycled through enough constructs that its cyclical nature itself becomes visible and legible, which is the point of `heritageRotation()`'s design (`src/qise/reading-pipeline.js`). |
| Day 90 | A quarter's worth of then/now comparisons across a real range of dates. Established Qi Se baseline throughout. |
| Day 180 | Half a year of playback; genuinely long-baseline trajectory language becomes honest to use. |
| Day 365 | A year-in-review is possible against real seasonal/lifestyle variation the user actually lived through, not a synthetic approximation of it. See `docs/PRODUCT_NORTH_STAR.md`'s "Day 365 experience" acceptance test. |
| Multi-year | The archive itself becomes the asset — see `docs/BACKUP_ARCHIVE_FORMAT.md`'s portability requirement, because a multi-year face-photo archive is exactly the kind of thing that must survive this product disappearing. |

No milestone is granted early by manufacturing data to simulate having reached it. If a metric
requires 90 days of real capture, showing it at day 40 with synthetic padding is exactly the
"loot-box"/fabrication failure this contract exists to prevent, even though it is not literally a
loot box.

## Determinism is preserved — novelty comes from real dimensions, never from randomness

`docs/PRODUCT_INVARIANTS.md` I2 already requires that returning states receive **deterministic
but meaning-preserving** variation. This program does not weaken that to manufacture daily
novelty. Legitimate sources of novelty, all already present in the codebase's design or specified
in this program's architecture docs:

- accumulated history (more segment data => `historyStageOf`, `recentMovements` genuinely differ);
- trajectory (`trajectoryOf()` in `src/qise/reading-state.js`);
- occurrence (`occurrenceIndexFor()` walks the same deterministic state-key history every time);
- heritage rotation (`heritageRotation()` — a legible cycle, not a hash);
- a new real capture (a new frame exists that did not exist yesteday);
- a new Daily Portrait baseline stage (PR C);
- a new actual measurement (Qi Se's own delta-vs-baseline arithmetic);
- timeline playback modes newly available because enough history exists;
- newly-available longitudinal comparisons (then/now pairs that did not exist until both ends of
  the pair were captured).

Explicitly not a legitimate source of novelty: `Math.random()`, a date-derived seed used as a
substitute for a real state dimension, cosmetic noise injected into otherwise-identical output, or
fabricated "daily fortune" content unconnected to any measured or historical fact. Any future
retention mechanism proposed against this contract is checked against this list before it ships.

## Steady days are a first-class experience

Retention must work when the face does not materially change — most days, for most users, this is
the common case, not the edge case. A steady day still legitimately gains value from: another real
timeline frame existing (item 1 above); the baseline maturing (item 4); recurrence context (a
"this is the fourth time you've measured `ping`/level this month" kind of honest observation,
built from real occurrence counts, never invented); a genuine return-to-usual event (the state
changed and then changed back — that is real information, not padding); a heritage discovery the
user has not seen in this rotation before; or a user-initiated reflection (a journalling prompt,
already part of the product's layered-reading design in `docs/PROJECT_CHARTER.md`).

**What is not acceptable:** manufacturing a "finding" because a steady day is otherwise
uneventful. If nothing changed and no new heritage content is due, the honest response is calm,
plain language saying so — not an invented observation dressed up to look like news.

## No appearance judgment, ever, from any retention mechanism

Retention copy may never imply "better", "worse", "younger", "older than expected",
attractiveness, weight change, health, stress, beauty, or symmetry quality — regardless of how the
underlying measurement actually moved. This applies to every milestone, every steady-day message,
and every playback caption. See `docs/PRODUCT_NORTH_STAR.md`'s non-goals and
`docs/DAILY_PORTRAIT_ARCHITECTURE.md`'s "no appearance judgment from the timeline" for the copy
vocabulary this implies.

## The hard retention question, and how it is measured

*When does this app run out of interesting things to say or show?* — is a first-class, measured
question, not a design aspiration. `docs/HERITAGE_LIBRARY_READINESS.md` reports the measured
answer for the heritage dimension specifically (exact repetition intervals, material diversity,
exhaustion point) across the four separately-labelled retention analyses defined there
(`PUBLIC_SHIPPED_RETENTION`, `INTERNAL_REFLECTION_RETENTION`, `LATENT_HERITAGE_EXHAUSTION`,
`DAILY_PORTRAIT_COMPOUNDING_MODEL`). This contract does not restate those numbers — they are
measured, dated evidence, not a durable product commitment, and belong in one place so they cannot
drift out of step with the code that produces them.

## Product-moat check

Before any future feature is added under this contract, it should be able to answer: does this
strengthen the combination named in `docs/PRODUCT_NORTH_STAR.md` (disciplined guided capture +
self-relative baseline + provenance-rich heritage + honest measurement/tradition separation +
portable long-lived archive), or does it strengthen only one part in a way a generic selfie app
could copy in a week on its own? Work that does not strengthen the combination is deprioritised,
not necessarily rejected outright — but it does not draw on this contract's retention-legitimacy
list to justify itself.
