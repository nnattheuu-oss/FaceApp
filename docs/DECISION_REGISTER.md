# Decision register

Use this register to stop prompts, discussions and implementation from collapsing into one another. A proposal becomes approved only when the product owner records approval in a pull request or decision record.

## Established and implemented

- Scanner-first, on-device PWA; current application code is plain JavaScript.
- MediaPipe Tasks Vision is a runtime dependency; Playwright is a development dependency.
- Raw camera frames are not persisted or transmitted.
- Persisted data is constructed from allow-listed derived fields, with negative scanning as defence in depth.
- Entertainment/self-discovery positioning; no diagnosis, medical claim, identity, attractiveness score, fortune/prediction or fixed-trait conclusion.
- en-AU user-facing spelling.
- Existing release commands are the scripts in `package.json`, including `scripts/check-release.js`; `verify-release.mjs` does not exist.
- Five Mountains and Twelve Palaces are separate systems; the nose/central mountain maps to Earth in the Five Mountains model.
- Exact geometry with insufficient evidence is marked `needsVerification: true` and is not shipped as fact.
- Current history/baseline behaviour and limits remain as implemented until deliberately migrated.
- Heritage connector architecture Stages 1 (data spine) and 2 (deterministic resolver) are approved and frozen; see `docs/HERITAGE_CONNECTOR_STAGE_STATUS.md` for the frozen code baseline, verification counts and architectural locks. Stage 3 (prose/Reflection Engine integration) **code is present on `main`** (merged via PR #40, 30 August 2026 correction — the previous "has not started" line here was stale). Presence is not approval: see `docs/HERITAGE_CONNECTOR_STAGE_STATUS.md`'s six-axis status for what is and is not true of Stage 3 as a result, and `docs/heritage-evidence/SAFETY_AUTHORIZATION_INTERFACE.md` for why it remains fail-closed in production regardless.

### DR-2026-08-25-AI-CONTEXT-MODEL-ROUTING

- **Date:** 25 August 2026
- **Owner:** product owner
- **Status:** approved
- **Decision:**
    - Claude is reserved primarily for research, source adjudication, architecture and difficult semantic/safety review.
    - Gemini Flash is the default worker for bounded implementation, repetitive coding, repository administration and mechanical verification.
    - /compact is required during genuinely long same-task Claude sessions.
    - /clear is required when switching materially different tasks.
    - Repository checkpoints/canonical docs are persistent project memory; large chat histories are not.
    - This routing changes development workflow only and does not weaken provenance, safety, heritage freezes, release gates or product contracts.

### DR-2026-08-31-D2-CONNECTOR-PREDICATE

- **Date:** 31 August 2026
- **Owner:** product owner
- **Status:** approved
- **Context:** `docs/HERITAGE_CONNECTOR_RELATIONSHIP_CONTRACT.md` established that no heritage
  connector is both measurable from a flat photograph and authorised for presentation, so the
  connector layer contributes exactly one state everywhere. These four decisions respond to that
  finding.

- **D2-1 — APPROVED.** Promote `three-sections-facial-proportion-taiqing` from `RESEARCH_ONLY` to
  `HERITAGE_PRESENTATION_ALLOWED`, and route `threeSections/primary` from `RESEARCH_ONLY` to
  `RUNTIME_PROSE`. **Must land together with D2-2** — the promotion is not authorised on its own,
  because the promoted record's source text carries a rank clause.

- **D2-2 — APPROVED WITH ENFORCEMENT.** The product may carry the source-attested geometric
  predicate while excluding the fortune/status clause.
    - The full source text remains in the evidence registry for audit and provenance.
    - Runtime surfaces may expose only the verified geometric excerpt and a project-owned
      translation.
    - 上相, 貴, and any English rank, status or fortune interpretation must never appear in
      Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, source cards, accessibility text, exports or share surfaces.
    - An `excludedPredicateClauses` field is **necessary but not sufficient**. It must be consumed
      or otherwise enforced by the reader-facing path and pinned by negative tests. Unused
      metadata does not satisfy this decision.

- **D2-3 — APPROVED, with the corrected record set.** Exactly **two** Three Sections predicate
  records in total, never three:
    1. **Retain and update** the existing `three-sections-facial-proportion-taiqing` —
       `relationshipPredicate: 相稱`, `disagreementIds: ["three-sections-predicate"]`,
       `alternateConnectorIds: ["three-sections-pingdeng-yuguan"]`, plus the approved explicit
       fortune-clause exclusion.
    2. **Add exactly one** new record, `three-sections-pingdeng-yuguan`.
  A `three-sections-xiangcheng-taiqing` record must **not** be created — it would duplicate the
  existing Taiqing record. After promotion, active count and connector residue must be exactly
  **2**, not 3.

- **D2-4 — HOLD THE TARGET.** Gate D stays at 250 and `NOT_READY` is accepted. The threshold is
  not to be revised to fit the current corpus. A later evidence-based capacity review may
  reconsider it only after source acquisition. **Passing the gate is not authorised during this
  task.**

- **Consequence recorded, not decided here:** satisfying D2-2's enforcement clause requires a
  bounded Stage 1/2 freeze exception on `src/heritage/resolver.js`'s `toResolvedEntry()`. See
  `docs/HERITAGE_CONNECTOR_RELATIONSHIP_CONTRACT.md` §6 — that exception is proposed, not
  approved, and no implementation may proceed without it.

- **Implementation clarification (31 August 2026, same date).** Two corrections to how D2-1 is
  realised, given by the product owner alongside the approval of the bounded `resolver.js`
  exception above:
    1. **The `resolver.js` exception is scoped to exactly `relationshipPredicate` and
       `excludedPredicateClauses`.** No `predicateTranslation` field, no new enum, and no changes
       to `connectors.js`/`schema.js`/`validator.js` — narrower than the exception originally
       proposed in the contract document's §6.5.
    2. **D2-1 is implemented by ROUTING, not by promoting the contested lineage.** Rather than
       moving `threeSections/primary`'s literal registry key (the received Ma Yi lineage) to
       `RUNTIME_PROSE`, `ABSTRACT_LINEAGE_OVERRIDES.threeSections.primary` (a mechanism already
       reserved in `composition.js` for exactly this kind of decision) now resolves the
       CONNECTOR-resolution path's abstract "primary" request to the verified
       `taiqing-mianbu-facial` lineage instead. The Ma Yi lineage itself is untouched, stays
       `RESEARCH_ONLY`, and is never the source of an active passage — satisfying the requirement
       that its "the reading is auspicious" clause never render as active user inference.
       `heritageMaterialFor()` (the PASSAGE renderer) does not consult this override and continues
       to read the literal `"primary"` key, so the passage for `threeSections/primary` continues
       to abstain exactly as before this decision.
    Implemented in commit `4c36c2c`-onward on `claude/heritage-connector-relationships-d2`; full
    trace in `docs/HERITAGE_CONNECTOR_RELATIONSHIP_CONTRACT.md` §8. This is exactly one connector
    (`three-sections-facial-proportion-taiqing`) activated, not the full two-record D2-3 scope —
    the second (`three-sections-pingdeng-yuguan`) record remains future work under this decision.

- **D2-3 IMPLEMENTED (1 September 2026).** The second record, `three-sections-pingdeng-yuguan`,
  is now added, following the field-by-field spec in `docs/agents/D2_GEMINI_HANDOFF.md` Task 2b
  exactly: `relationshipPredicate: 平等`, `excludedPredicateClauses: ["和美"]` (the verse's
  harmony/beauty consequence-clause, excluded on the same grounds as the sibling record's `上相`),
  `sourceId: heritage-three-sections-yuguan` (an independent, byte-pinned, `VERIFIED_PRIMARY`
  Southern Tang/early Song witness — not a Ma Yi source and not the same juan as the Taiqing
  facial material), `alternateConnectorIds`/`disagreementIds` cross-referencing its sibling. The
  existing Taiqing record gained the corresponding `disagreementIds`/`alternateConnectorIds`
  fields the D2-3 spec requires. No third record was created; `three-sections-xiangcheng-taiqing`
  remains absent and forbidden. Both connectors reach `ACTIVE` disposition, measured through the
  production composition seam: `threeSections/primary` active count and connector residue are
  both exactly **2**, matching this entry's "never three" requirement. Ma Yi and its lineage are
  untouched, still `RESEARCH_ONLY`. Gate D (`DIVERSITY_TARGET = 250`, D2-4) is untouched and still
  fails; `NOT_READY` is unchanged. Full trace, measured numbers, and the leak-check methodology in
  `docs/HERITAGE_CONNECTOR_RELATIONSHIP_CONTRACT.md` §8.7.

## Approved direction, not necessarily complete

- Scanner-first Android TWA route and GitHub-hosted HTTPS deployment.
- Still-photo fallback and explicit capture-session lifecycle ownership.
- A premium editorial, anti-generic visual system.
- Broader, source-led interpretation coverage with deterministic eligibility and abstention.
- No ads and no weekly subscription.
- Independent compliance and release review.
- A human-supervised cloud development path using a two-core GitHub Codespace and interactive Gemini CLI sign-in. It creates task branches and pull requests; it does not add runtime AI or a public-comment agent trigger.

### DR-2026-08-24-HERITAGE-CONNECTOR-STAGES-1-2-FREEZE

- **Date:** 24 August 2026
- **Owner:** product owner
- **Status:** approved
- **Decision:** Heritage connector architecture Stage 1 (the typed connector-graph data spine — `HERITAGE_REGISTRY`, `HERITAGE_CONNECTOR_REGISTRY`, and the surrounding Stage 1 registries/schema/validator) and Stage 2 (the deterministic, pure `resolveHeritageConnections` resolver in `src/heritage/resolver.js`) are both APPROVED and FROZEN.
- **Frozen Stage-2 code baseline:** `df8cf22b9257c2a7fb75affd30b5e7dc6d15caa0` on `feature/heritage-connectors`, full detail in `docs/HERITAGE_CONNECTOR_STAGE_STATUS.md`.
- **Rationale:** Both stages went through repeated, specific correction rounds against detailed review, ending in a resolver whose finite/fail-closed contracts, condition-AST semantics, and Stage 1/Module boundaries are all pinned by named tests. Freezing establishes a stable base for Stage 3 (prose/Reflection Engine integration) rather than leaving Stage 2 as an indefinite moving target.
- **Consequence:** `src/heritage/resolver.js` and its Stage 1 registries are not to be modified without a demonstrated regression against one of the architectural locks recorded in `docs/HERITAGE_CONNECTOR_STAGE_STATUS.md`. Stage 3 branches from `main` after this freeze, not from `feature/heritage-connectors`.
- **Explicit non-consequence:** This freeze does not itself authorise Stage 3 work to begin; Stage 3 remains a separate, not-yet-started decision.

### DR-2026-08-19-CULTURAL-REVIEW-RETIREMENT

- **Date:** 19 August 2026
- **Owner:** product owner
- **Status:** approved
- **Decision:** The independent cultural-review requirement is retired.
- **Rationale:** The product owner has decided not to make external cultural review a mandatory dependency for development or commercial release.
- **Consequence:** No signed reviewer artifact, disposition JSON, or cultural-review approval is required by release tooling.
- **Explicit non-consequence:** This decision does not authorise unsupported claims and does not weaken legal, rights, safety, provenance, or evidence-integrity requirements.

### DR-2026-08-17-B020-CLASS-A

- **Date:** 17 August 2026
- **Owner:** product owner
- **Status:** approved
- **Question:** B-020 produced fourteen open dispositions (R1–R14). Which can the product owner settle alone, and what are they?
- **Decision:** the ten Class-A rows below are approved as recorded. R3, R6, R8 and R9 are **not** approved and remain provisional pending independent cultural review; the fact that the flagged corpus already embodies the recommendation for those rows is a build artefact, not a disposition. Superseded for cultural-review dependency by DR-2026-08-19-CULTURAL-REVIEW-RETIREMENT.

| Row | Decision |
|---|---|
| R1 | The construct is **Three Sections** 三停. "Three Courts" is withdrawn — no scholarly source for it was located and 停 does not mean "court". |
| R2 | **Harmony is not one of the six enduring constructs.** It remains available only as an explicitly computed proportion score, labelled as our own measure. |
| R4 | **北岳 = 頦** (menton). 頷 and 地閣 are retained and versioned in the source notes as alternative readings. |
| R5 | **中岳 = 鼻**, subject to measurement availability. The traditional criterion is prominence, which a front-facing capture cannot recover, so the region abstains. |
| R7 | Ship the **five-type Five Elements reduction**, stating clearly that 靈樞·陰陽二十五人 defines twenty-five. The tonal subdivision has no visual correlate. |
| R10 | **Subject-side laterality**, enforced by a CI mirroring test. The 男左女右 rule is **rejected** — unattested in every source retrieved, and it would make output depend on declared gender. |
| R11 | The **fourteen prohibited inferences** in `OPTION_B_020_DOSSIER.md` §10.2 are absolute product constraints, pending legal confirmation where marked. |
| R12 | Safety-gate copy is **completely non-specific** and never names a clinical finding, pending legal confirmation. |
| R13 | **假神 is removed** from the rule system. Gate precedence is enforced programmatically with negative tests, not by convention. |
| R14 | The **diagonal-earlobe-crease gate is withdrawn from v1** and the charter is amended. The MediaPipe canonical mesh contains no auricle geometry; `src/engine.js:227` already recorded this. |

- **Evidence:** `docs/OPTION_B_020_DOSSIER.md` and `docs/OPTION_B_020_DISPOSITIONS.md`, which carry the source, the consequence and the risk both ways for each row.
- **Consequences:** these are decisions, not recommendations. Corpus and code may be changed to match without further approval. They do **not** approve any heritage family for commercial release — all six remain `Blocked` in `docs/commercial-rights-audit.md`.
- **Explicitly not decided:** R3 (Four Rivers lineage), R6 (五官 membership), R8 (妻妾宮 / 奴僕宮 handling), R9 (colour as classifier input). R9's recommendation — exclusion — is additionally constrained by EU AI Act Art. 5(1)(g) and should not be treated as a free choice.

### DR-2026-08-17-REFLECTION-ENGINE-INTERNAL-DEFAULT

- **Date:** 17 August 2026
- **Owner:** product owner
- **Status:** approved
- **Question:** The Reflection Engine has met the engineering bar. Should it become the default?
- **Decision:** **internal default yes, public default no.** Development proceeds against the Reflection Engine; public release behaviour stays on the passage engine until the heritage rights gates close. Superseded for cultural-review dependency by DR-2026-08-19-CULTURAL-REVIEW-RETIREMENT.
- **Mechanism:** `src/qise/reading-flags.js` defaults to `on` for development origins on a named allowlist and `off` for every other origin, including any it has never heard of. This was chosen over a build flag deliberately: a build flag can be set wrongly in a release pipeline and fails open in public; a host allowlist fails closed. `?reflection=` and stored preference still override in both directions, and `compare` remains available.
- **Evidence:** `docs/PARITY_2026-08-17.md` — ten of ten migration gates pass, 1,152 real records, zero regressions, 0.0% verbatim repetition over a simulated year against the passage engine's 26.8%.
- **Consequences:** the passage engine is **not** removed. Both engines remain, and the parity gate keeps running against both.

### DR-2026-08-15-DAILY-LOOP

- **Date:** 15 August 2026
- **Owner:** product owner
- **Status:** approved
- **Question:** Should the product remain an enduring portrait, enhanced by the existing Qi Se longitudinal comparison, or expand into a daily loop that crosses structural constructs with additional measured transient variables and parallel corpora?
- **Decision:** Option B — daily loop. Run it as an ordered research → design → proof → implementation programme under a dedicated Daily Loop Program Architect. The programme is defined in `docs/OPTION_B_PROGRAM.md` and its executable queue is `docs/OPTION_B_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`.
- **Existing foundation:** Qi Se already measures personal-baseline deviation, history and magnitude bands. Preserve and reuse that implementation unless a separately approved migration has evidence for changing it.
- **Unproven scope:** “Shen burst variance” and “baseline-relative tension delta” are research labels, not established production signals. Current burst jitter is capture-quality data and current blendshape/asymmetry output describes one capture. Neither may drive a user-facing reading until its versioned contract and independent proof verdict pass.
- **Consequences:** approving Option B commits the product direction and the research programme; it does not pre-approve a measurement definition, threshold, source interpretation, persistence change, corpus claim or release. Failed proof means abstention, redesign or removal—not a weakened gate.
- **Execution authority:** the dedicated agent may research, design and implement on task branches, run checks, commit, push and open draft pull requests. It may not approve its own evidence, mark a pull request ready, merge, alter acceptance criteria to obtain a pass or issue the final release verdict.
- **Human and external gates:** the product owner retains product decisions and diff review. Consented participant/device evidence, source review, legal/rights review, the unresolved history-retention decision and store approval cannot be manufactured or self-certified by an agent. Superseded for cultural-review dependency by DR-2026-08-19-CULTURAL-REVIEW-RETIREMENT.
- **Supersedes:** the unresolved state of this same decision record. Option A is parked, not the selected product direction.

### DR-2026-09-06-SCANNER-CAPTURE-CORRECTION

- **Date:** 6 September 2026
- **Owner:** product owner
- **Status:** approved and implemented
- **Context:** the beta scanner could not complete a capture in any room. Root cause: an
  `illuminant` gate that had no sclera sample to judge returned the same shape (`margin: -1`) as a
  gate that measured a REAL problem, and `-1` sorted ahead of every genuine failure — so a face
  failing only on eye visibility was told to change its lamps, unconditionally, forever. CLAUDE.md
  item 54 had already claimed this was fixed and pinned by a test; neither existed. Diagnosed and
  scoped in `docs/agents/BETA_CAPTURE_FIX_BRIEF.md` (PR #55, superseded by this record and its
  implementation — see below). This correction also found the beta had never adopted several
  capture-runtime behaviours production already had (autofocus recovery, the light escape hatch,
  real halo markup), and that neither surface used distinct-video-frame scheduling or prevented a
  screen-light assist from becoming the burst's illuminant.
- **Decision — four principles, binding on this codebase's capture and gate architecture:**
    1. **A Qi Se reading requires usable illuminant evidence.** Missing sclera evidence is not the
       same product state as strange coloured light actually measured. `SCLERA UNAVAILABLE` routes
       to an instruction about WHY the sclera could not be read (eyes, or darkness); only a
       genuinely measured out-of-tolerance reading may show the coloured-light instruction.
    2. **Missing evidence never becomes a fabricated measurement failure.** Every gate result now
       carries a `status` of `"pass" | "fail" | "blocked" | "unavailable"`, not a bare margin.
       Only `"fail"` is a real measurement outside its allowed range; `captureInstruction` prefers
       any `"fail"` over a `"blocked"`/`"unavailable"` entry regardless of margin, and resolves a
       blocked entry through its named `blockedBy` gate and `reason` rather than inventing a
       diagnosis for a measurement that was never taken. Implemented generically in
       `src/qise/gates.js`, not as a one-off patch to `illuminant` alone — `filter` uses the same
       mechanism when the sharpness Laplacian could not be computed at all.
    3. **Screen illumination is an acquisition aid, never the measurement's illuminant.** The
       white screen-light assist may help find a face, let autofocus lock, and make the preview
       readable, but a burst may never complete while it is active — a browser cannot standardise
       a phone's own display brightness, so light bounced off it is not a controlled illuminant.
       Every on/off transition resets the capture hold and releases any exposure/white-balance
       lock taken under the light that just changed; once ambient light alone looks sustainable
       for a full hold, the assist is tried off, and a fresh hold is required before any burst.
       Implemented as `ScreenAssistGuard`/`gatesPassForHold()` in `src/qise/capture-runtime.js`
       (new capacity for the beta) and as an equivalent gating condition on production's existing
       `screenLightRequested` state (`src/ui/qise/app.js`) — production had exactly the gap this
       decision describes, evidenced by its own code comment ("It stays on through the hold and
       burst") until this correction.
    4. **Thresholds are not the fix.** No focus, distance, sclera-minimum or exposure threshold
       changed. The measurement-seam corrections above are architectural, not calibration; where a
       measurement is itself under-evidenced (the underexposure metric's skin-reflectance
       confound — already tracked below under Unresolved proposals) it stays flagged rather than
       silently retuned.
- **What was implemented (see PR opened from branch `claude/scanner-capture-correction`):**
    - Gate dependency model (`src/qise/gates.js`, `src/qise/framestats.js`) — principle 1 and 2,
      pinned by `tests/qise/gate-dependency.test.js`. This also corrects CLAUDE.md item 54, which
      claimed this fix already existed; it did not, and item 54 is corrected in the same PR.
    - `src/qise/frame-scheduler.js` — distinct decoded-video-frame scheduling
      (`requestVideoFrameCallback`, with a `currentTime`-deduped `requestAnimationFrame` fallback),
      adopted by both the beta and production capture loops. Neither previously distinguished a
      display repaint from a new camera frame, which a 120Hz panel against a 30–60fps camera makes
      routine.
    - `src/qise/capture-runtime.js` — `ScreenAssistGuard` (principle 3), `RefocusRecovery` and
      `StallTracker`, extracted so a decision that already existed correctly in production is
      available to the beta rather than reimplemented divergently.
    - `src/qise/frame-geometry.js` — the on-screen face guide is now sized from the SAME
      `DISTANCE_MIN_FRACTION` the distance gate enforces, mapped through the actual
      `object-fit: cover` crop, rather than an independently chosen percentage that could (and
      did) silently disagree with what the gate measured.
    - `src/qise/diagnostics.js` — a development-flag-gated (`?devtelemetry=1` / `?captdbg=1`),
      non-biometric capture-telemetry recorder (device capabilities, frame throughput,
      time-to-milestone, refocus/assist-cycle counts, per-blocker stall duration). No pixel, mesh
      or landmark is ever accepted by any of its methods. For the next physical-device test.
    - The beta's capture stage gained the real quality-ring markup its own JS had queried for
      since it shipped (`createExposureHalo`'s `[data-halo-progress]` lookup had always returned
      null), a neutral acquisition-light wash kept structurally separate from the ring's colour
      states, the same four-chip readiness strip production uses, and hidden-by-default debug
      output — a consumer mid-capture no longer sees `L*`/`WB`/`HALO` readouts.
    - Two real bugs found in the existing Playwright e2e fixtures while building the verification
      for this: `launchArgs` is not a Playwright Test option (the real key is
      `launchOptions.args`), and `--use-file-for-fake-video-capture` alone registers no device
      without `--use-fake-device-for-media-stream` alongside it. Both meant the fake camera never
      engaged and every existing beta e2e test tolerated a real `NotFoundError`, passing anyway.
    - `e2e/beta-capture-finalisation.spec.js` and `e2e/qise-capture-finalisation.spec.js` — genuine
      positive and negative controls driving the REAL, unmodified capture code through a
      canvas-painted synthetic face (built from the same canonical reference mesh every unit test
      already uses) to an actually-stored reading, on both surfaces. Explicitly not a MediaPipe
      accuracy test (the mesh is supplied, not detected) — the existing smoke tests against the
      real bundle remain what proves MediaPipe itself still loads.
- **What was deliberately NOT done, and why:** no threshold changed (principle 4); the underexposure
  metric's skin-reflectance confound is not re-derived (already correctly tracked below, under
  Unresolved proposals, as needing recorded physical-device evidence, not a guess); no rewrite of
  production's illumination-check, selfie-upload, or twelve-palace reading logic — the two changes
  to `src/ui/qise/app.js` are the frame-scheduler swap and the screen-assist hold-gating, verified
  by a new e2e smoke test plus the full existing `qise-integration`/`qise-redesign` suites, which
  all still pass; a full visual redesign of the capture journey is parked behind
  `docs/VISUAL_DIRECTION.md`'s research-note prerequisite (a bounded note was produced alongside
  this record — see `docs/design/CAPTURE_JOURNEY_RESEARCH_NOTE.md`).
- **Physical-device verification (explicitly NOT claimed by this record):** everything above was
  verified in a sandboxed Linux CI-style environment with a synthetic camera. What real Android
  camera buffer dimensions and orientation are, what sclera pixel yield a real eye produces, and
  whether the quality ring/refocus/assist behaviour reads correctly on an actual screen all remain
  to be checked on a Samsung device — the diagnostics module above exists specifically so that
  test can report back more than "it worked" or "it didn't".
- **PR #55 disposition:** closed as superseded. It was a diagnosis-only handoff brief written
  against an earlier state of `main`; this record and its implementation supersede it directly.

## Unresolved proposals

These must not be implemented as settled decisions without approval:

- A strict rolling 90-day TTL for derived IndexedDB history. Reconcile it with the existing baseline window, migration, user controls and deletion semantics first.
- React/Vite migration. If approved, explicitly solve GitHub Pages base paths and MediaPipe WASM/asset resolution; this is not a current-stack bug.
- Exact lifetime, quarterly and annual prices and which SKU launches first.
- Whether the product is legally a biometric categorisation system, whether Article 50(3) applies, and the resulting notice flow.
- A future corpus-schema property for tradition attribution. Current DOM markers use kebab-case `data-copy`; do not infer a JSON field name from that syntax.
- Unimplemented scanner improvements, including underexposure rejection and any threshold changes. Thresholds require recorded evidence and must not be silently retuned.
- Mappings where primary sources disagree, including left/right cheek traditions.
